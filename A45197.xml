         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Men to relieve themſelves from inward reproach, whilſt they contradict their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſe, have found out the ſpecious names of Civility, Submiſſion to our Superiours; Nay, have uſurpt the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name of the Virtue of Modeſty, (which is the Nobleſt and moſt ample Virtue, which gives Rules that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt comprehenſive of our whole Duty; for to this Virtue we owe a greatneſs of Mind, and a reverence of our ſelves, as well as equability and Juſtice to others) to varniſh over Diſſimulation, Craft, Hypocriſie, Flattery, Treachery, Falſhood, and a deceitful Converſation: And are bold to reproach the ſevere Honeſt, with the Names of Moroſe, Diſloyal, and
<pb facs="tcp:50667:4"/> Diſobedient, to turn off from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſhame of their own prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and utter defections from publick Intereſt; which God knows men eaſily ſlide into inſenſibly, if they once ſuffer themſelves for any regard whatſoever to be carried off from the Rule of Right; for they bring themſelves under ſome kind of Neceſſities of complying with the Evils their firſt aberrations occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, by greater faults; which increaſe reciprocally at every turn, until they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come deſperate Out-laws, abſolve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all Duty they owe to their King and Countrey, abandon themſelves to Chance, to live and ſubſiſt by unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhifts and arts, which increaſe their firſt Guilts, and turn their Errors into unpardonable Crimes: having ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck'd their Conſciences, they care not if the Government be wreck'd too, to which they have made themſelves ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abnoxious.</p>
                  <p>This whilſt men pleaſe others, they

                     <hi>He that deſpiſeth his own way, ſhall dye,</hi> ſaith King <hi>Solomon.</hi> A man that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates himſelf to ſerve Occaſions, diſſembles himſelf, and appears other than he is; will ſoon extinguiſh his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and dye to Virtue. He that doth not honour himſelf, will not regard men; and they that do not Reverence Men, will not fear God: <hi>Qui non verentur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, fallent Deos.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Arts of Complaiſance ſo much relyed upon at the Courts of Princes, hath extruded the Laws of Honeſty thence, where they are moſt neceſſary. This hath made the Condition of great Men very uncertain and fortuitous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely ſubject to Chance and Hazard, the Thrones of Princes unſtable and tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, and left the Peace and Security of Kingdoms ſcarce at any time undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed with Fears &amp; Jealouſies, evil ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb facs="tcp:50667:5"/> and contending Factions, upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons true and falſe, real and feigned cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Every man almoſt is ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the uneaſie condition that he himſelf concurs to make to himſelf, but is always in ſome ſort miſerable, by fearing from others whom he gives too much cauſe to fear from himſelf, and to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt him for his double dealing. But what other conſequence can they expect, that ever feign, and unceſſantly diſſemble, but not to be believed, not to be truſted, hated for their baſeneſs, and feared for that great Evil they would diſſemble. The greatneſs of the Evil deſigned, is juſtly meaſured by the coarſe and baſe Artifices they uſe to hide them: they are impudent to all the diſcerning and wiſe, whilſt they buſily ſet themſelves by mean and baſe Arts to abuſe the Fools and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, the vain and the credulous; whom they have at the ſame time in the greateſt ſcorn, whilſt they have nothing to value themſelves upon, but that ſuch little men are deceived by them.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:5"/>
                  <p>But there is another ſort of men that deſign well for the Publick, whilſt they diſpenſe with the ſtrict Laws of Truth and Sincerity. But I cannot tell upon the whole matter, whether they are not more hurtful to themſelves, than profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the Common-wealth, by their well-deſign'd and honeſtly-directed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances and diſſimulations. I mean, ſuch men as lend themſelves to the ſervice of the Publick; who are ſo kind as to disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure themſelves, to take other ſhapes and appearances of what they are not: Who are content to neglect their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reputation of Sincerity, whilſt under a feigned aſſentation they hinder all the evil, and do all the good they can do, and the preſent ſtate of things will permit; and ſuffer the reſt with a great compaſſion for the Publick Weal. But ſuch mens Praiſe muſt come from God, their Honour will never be entire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men; and after all the difficult and hazardous Services they can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb facs="tcp:50667:6"/> for their King and Countrey, their Honour will ſtill remain ſuſpected, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and obſcure amongſt men, who muſt judge according to appearance. When we have been often abuſed by the faireſt pretenders to a regular and conſtant Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, we cannot eaſily truſt thoſe that have ſometime diſſembled and repreſt it.</p>

                  <p>It is a peculiar Felicity of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that from a Generous and Honeſt Nature, and a Noble Mind, rather than from the inſtitution of Books (though your Learning is famouſly great) to which you ſeem made rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; your ſincerity is incorruptible, and ſtands in no need of that Artificial Defenſative and Out-work which is preſcribed by great Moraliſts, as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to weak Minds to ſecure their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, eſpecially when Virtue it ſelf is out of Repute and diſgraced.</p>
                  <p>You have perſiſted conſtantly in one even Tenor of Life, have been Uniform,
<pb facs="tcp:50667:6"/> Regular, and Conſiſtent with your ſelf. There may have been ſome complyance in appearance to your Lordſhip, but you never yet departed from your ſelf; nay, you have not ſo much as incur'd the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of ſo doing. No man makes any Queſtion about your Lordſhip, or what it is you deſign; it is no mans Enquiry, no mans doubt: You have been always the ſame, and are, as every man concludes, immutably ſo. You are not unhappy to paſs under Conjectures and various Opinions, there is no need of a Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptique man to unriddle any intricacies in the courſe of your Life.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:50667:7"/> with himſelf, and takes himſelf in a ſort reproved by every honeſt man, as every man doth that condemns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

That I adventure to appear to ſo great a Judgment, is the beſt Argument I can uſe to the World for my integrity and honeſt deſignment therein; and beſides, the good Opinion of ſo great a man as your ſelf, would give great aſſurance to my own Conſcience. If your Lordſhip doth think any thing therein uſeful to the World, I am ſure it will have your Lordſhips Countenance, which will make them more uſeful, ſince, as my Lord

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Cannot but take notice, That my honeſt Deſign in my <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript,</hi> to ſerve the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and therein the Nation, hath been by many perverted: and how it hath been endeavoured to make them looſe that effect to which they were ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely directed. I have therein aſſerted the rightful Authority the Biſhops have in the Government, &amp; repreſented the juſt Expectations the Nation hath of their due Exerciſe of that Authority for the publick good; and have endeavoured to remove the great prejudice againſt their
<pb facs="tcp:50667:9"/> Order, eſpecially thoſe that are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Miſtakes of the Inferiour Clergy; for ſuch we have taken notice of, as thoſe which do moſt hurt, then eſteem and affect them with the greateſt diſhonour and danger. I have therein faithfully defended the Authority and Power of the Biſhops in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But theſe I take to be but other Names for the <hi>Duty</hi> they owe to the Common-wealth. Civil Honours and Dignities declare reſpectively the truſts that the Government hath plac'd in the perſons under ſuch Characters, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſure the Duties and Offices that are expected from them. The preſent ſtate of the Kingdom doth moſt importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately urge and require, that they ſhould perform their duty in its fulleſt and utmoſt extent, and thereby vindicate the honour of their Order: It cannot fail being venerable, in the ſame degrees we find it beneficial. All poſitive Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties indeed have an indefinite latitude,
<pb facs="tcp:50667:9"/> and we have a great liberty in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of them: They are not peccant againſt the rule of Virtue, who do not always exhibit to us the moſt Excellent Actions. It is not expected from the Duty that every man owes to his King and Countrey, that he ſhould ſerve them always to his utmoſt Capacity, and with an Heroical Bravery. But he that doth not lend all the aſſiſtance to their ſervice which his place requires, and his power can perform, in the greateſt Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, in the Extreameſt need, is a wretched Traytor, and Betrayer of his Countrey.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> I have by no means leſſened the Authority of the Church, or narrowed their Capacity of ſerving the Publick weal. But with great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction conſidered their Authority, and how much they may contribute to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting our Diſtracted Nation, almoſt ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Diviſions, which are occaſioned and promoted by the Enemies of our
<pb facs="tcp:50667:10"/> Church, and principally deſigned for her Deſtruction. If we looſe our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for the ſake of her ruine, and in order to that we looſe it; and which is worſe, if we loſe it, it muſt be by the inſtrumentality of her Clergy: if the Government be not preſerved, the Church muſt periſh.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I did not confine my thoughts to a Defence of the Church her Rights, but employ'd them for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Church her ſelf, and did endeavour to remove ſome great Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and Miſtakes, that aſſiſt the deſigns of her Enemies upon her. Miſtakes to which our Enemies owe all the power they have to hurt us; in virtue of theſe Miſtakes, their malice is onely conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it could never have affected us, nor we brought within any danger or fear of them, if theſe vain Opinions had not been entertained by ſome of our Church-men.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:10"/>
                  <p>And yet two Diſcourſes ſo agreeable in all the parts thereof one to another united in Deſign, and that could not poſſibly but concur to the thoughts of any man that truly and heartily deſign'd to ſerve to the proſperity of the Church and State, are endeavoured to be ſet at variance with themſelves; and ſome there are ſo falſe and unjuſt, as to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, That the <hi>Argument</hi> for the Biſhops Right, was written to ſet off the <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipt</hi> with ſome advantage; and that the Author deſign'd to gain from the <hi>Argument,</hi> a more pardonable liberty of inveighing againſt the Church-men in the <hi>Poſtſcript.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this had been the conceit of men of the Popiſh Faction only (and not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of many Gentlemen whom I princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally deſigned to ſerve, and in them the Church of <hi>England,</hi> thereby) I ſhould not have thought it worthy my notice. For every man underſtands it is their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and deſign to divide the Church-men
<pb facs="tcp:50667:11"/> from the Intereſt of the Church, to ſet the Church againſt her ſelf. To rob the ſheep of their ſhepherds, and the paſtors of their flocks. They know (and true it is) that no good and uſeful Conſtitution can ever be deſtroyed but by it ſelf; <hi>i. e.</hi> by ceaſing to be ſo: And that the people will never part from any thing wherein they find their benefit and advantage; except they can deprave our Church, they can never hope to deſtroy her. They have cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſome of our Church-men with Principles that ſubvert our Government, and betray the Rights of our People. They have debauched the Manners of our Church-men, and leſſened their Authority and Eſteem with the people. The Order is enſlav'd by Collation of Preferments upon leſs worthy men. <hi>Qui beneficium accepit libertatem vendidit.</hi> They have raiſed a bitter zeal againſt that Separation, that they themſelves have contriv'd, fomented, and promoted.
<pb facs="tcp:50667:11"/> And it is brought to paſs, that thoſe are accounted <hi>Church-Fanaticks,</hi> though <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> that cannot contentedly ſee and endure the near approaches of ruine both of Church and State: Theſe are their fear and their hate. The Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> the Giants of the Land, that they they imagine ſo inſuperable, that they are for making themſelves a Captain and returning back into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Againſt theſe they exerciſe the keenneſs of their Wit; and to ſupply themſelves with matter of Raillery againſt them, they lick up the Vomit of the Popiſh Prieſts, and whatever is malitiouſly ſaid by them againſt the firſt Reformers, is daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by our young Clerks out of the Pulpit, with advantages of immodeſty and indiſcretion, for the diſſervice and diſhonour of their Order: with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Lies that the Papiſts have forg'd againſt <hi>Luther, Beza,</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other renowned inſtruments in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, they diſparage the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb facs="tcp:50667:12"/> of great ſervice this to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe young men, like Dotterels, Apes, and Parrots, who have no more underſtanding than thoſe Animals, are perpetually repeating any thing, though never ſo deſtructive to Church and State, that is ſuggeſted by any Popiſh Mercenary Writer, if he hath but the cunning to beſtow an idle Complement upon the Church, or calls Rogue and Villain ſeemingly or in pretence for their ſake; eſpecially, if he can furniſh to their young invention any Topicks of Raillery againſt an imaginary Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and againſt Parliaments, an eſſential part of our Government, and the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Liberty. A very fair capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and recommendation this (as they imagine) to Preferment. Theſe are the Men, I confeſs, for whoſe ſake I writ the <hi>Poſtſcript.</hi> And if it can conduce any thing either to reform them from their Errors, or elſe to make them of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb facs="tcp:50667:12"/> with the People. That they be not hereafter taken to ſpeak the ſenſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and we ty'd down to certain ruine by her pretended Authority. And eſpecially that ſhe may not hereafter ſuffer under the ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal of ſuch forward and precocious youths. I ſay, if I can obtain by my endeavours any of theſe effects in any degree, I reckon I have performed an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſervice to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>We have a ſort of young men, that have left nothing behind them in the Univerſity, but the taint of a bad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and brought no more Learning with them thence, than what ſerves to make them more aſſured and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Coxcombs; who will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to diſcourſe continually of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Religion, of which they have no manner of ſenſe; and of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Government, of which they are utterly ignorant.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:13"/>
                  <p>Theſe take our degenerate Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be the great Supporters of our Religion and Government, whoſe Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty conſiſts principally in Rounds of Brimmers and Huzzahs; who have not ſo much leiſure from their repeated Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and Debauches, as to conſider that they are not the wiſer for their Cups. In theſe Loyal Debauches too many of the young Clergy do moſt ſcandalouſly aſſiſt, for the ſervice of the Church, and for maintaining the honour of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. This, if the Superiour Clergy do not in time redreſs, they will betray our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ruine the Government both in Church and State. Theſe degenerate Levites are magnifying perpetually the Priviledges of their Tribe, extolling their Order, yet in terms that diſgrace it, but by their Lives they vilifie it. The moſt degenerate off-ſprings of Noble Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, are the greateſt Braggadocio's of their Diſcent: Thoſe boaſt moſt of their Anceſtors, who diſhonour them by their Relation.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:13"/>
                  <p>The Jews did not boaſt more of their Temple, the <hi>Templum Domini,</hi> the <hi>Templum Domini,</hi> at that time when they had filled up the meaſure of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and the deſtruction both of their Temple and Nation was at the door, (their Temple had not one ſtone left up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, and they carried into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity) than theſe Gentlemen do of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> when Popery is like to be let in upon her, by their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed follies, and indiſcretions: Popery, I ſay, which by ſome Doctrines undermines the very foundation, and by others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roofs the Edifice, and defaces the Walls of Chriſtian Faith, and leaves nothing thereof but Altar-ſtones for their Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Sacrifices: what ever the fates will be that they are pulling down upon the Nation.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtolicalneſs of their Order will not ſecure it, if they do not fill up the duty of their Office, no more than the <hi>Templum Domini</hi> did priviledge the
<pb facs="tcp:50667:14"/> Jewiſh Church and Nation from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>A Temple without a Numen, and an Undedicated Church, are things common and profane. They may remember there are Churches of Chriſt that do make a ſhift without their Order, and Religion need not periſh though the Order fail: but may ſubſiſt much eaſier than Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under Change of Governments, which yet generally laſt longer than any one form. Nothing can ſubſiſt longer, or at leaſt to any good purpoſe, than it anſwers the ends of its Inſtitution, and if it do not, it is much better that it ſhould not continue than that it ſhould ſubſiſt.</p>

Whereas our old Puritans and late Diſſenters, (I ſpeak of the groſs of them, for they are not anſwerable for the Fools and Rogues ſent amongſt them, or at leaſt ſpirited by the Roman Prieſts, no more than any other Party or Diviſion of men are for the Rogues that paſs under their numbers or reſpective denominations) have not diſliked the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Government; though by their ſenſeleſs and unaccountable ſcruples, they have depriv'd themſelves of the benefit of the Communion of our Church, and thereby give ſo much ſcandal to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb facs="tcp:50667:15"/> and make the Popiſh Plot conſiderable, which can no longer ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, than they are pleaſed to continue obſtinate in their conceited follies.</p>
                  <p>They beg to be re-admitted, to have the terms of our Communion made eaſie, by relaxation of a Ceremony or two, and a few matters of Scruple: To be received again under the Governance and Guidance of our Church; and are ready to acknowledge the benefit of the Epiſcopal Order in the Church of Chriſt. Let this be askt by any man, who doubts the truth thereof, of any man that is conſiderable amongſt our unhappy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters. Dr. <hi>Durel</hi> in his Book called <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciae Eccleſiae Anglicanae,</hi> tells what a high opinion the Reformed Churches abroad have of our Engliſh Epiſcopacy; and that the Biſhops were depoſed by them, becauſe they would not aſſiſt, but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, the Reformation, not of diſlike to their Order. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his <hi>Opuſc. de Neceſſitate Reformandae Eccleſiae,</hi> hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared

                  <p>Beſides, all amongſt us that have the name of Presbyterian called upon them at the pleaſure of the Popiſh Faction, ſubſcribe to the Nine and Thirty Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, in what they declare of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> about Obedience to our King and Governours,
<pb facs="tcp:50667:17"/> and are therefore in profeſſion as Loyal as any of thoſe that boaſt themſelves True Sons of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>Scotland</hi> hath been diſgrac'd by a vile ſort of Presbyterians, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true Presbyterian Sectaries in the world, in any conſiderable body or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe men have deſervedly put that name under eternal infamy, by their turbulent and contumacious carriage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kingly Authority.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpeak the truth, this is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable ſo much to Presbytery, as to the barbarous Manners and rough Genius of that Nation. Though it hath afforded ſome men in all Ages of great Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in all ſorts of the moſt commendable Qualities. That Nation was infamous for Diſloyalty, and a barbarous Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Kings, before <hi>Buchanan</hi> and <hi>Knox</hi> were born. The <hi>Scots</hi> boaſt of One hundred and fifty Kings in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion in that Kingdom: how many Names they have feigned to make out
<pb facs="tcp:50667:18"/> the boaſt of the Auncientry of their Kingdom, we do not know; but certain it is, they really Impriſoned, Depoſed, and Murdered Fifty of their Kings at leaſt, before the time of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> whoſe proſecution was promoted and aſſiſted by the Engliſh Biſhops. A fine Kingdom that, to make Experiments and try Concluſions upon!</p>
                  <p>There is little reaſon to charge the Guilt of the unexpiable Murder of our late Excellent King, for which at this day we are doing moſt ſevere penances, upon Presbytery, which was not thought of here in <hi>England</hi> till the War was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. The heats that produced that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy War, were from other Cauſes and Reaſons, as every body may know. But when that War was once begun, (as no War can be managed by fore-eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Rules and Meaſures) it did not ſtand within the reaſons and firſt deſigns thereof, but was proſecuted and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by ſuch means and meaſures as
<pb facs="tcp:50667:18"/> were neceſſary and poſſible. This will always happen more eſpecially in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War, wherein though both parties ſhare in the Cauſes, yet the Guilt to be ſure belongs to the Rebels ſide.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament in the Courſe of the War, in their diſtreſs, prayed Aid of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation, who was ſhortly before entered into the Covenant. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed them any Aſſiſtance, except they would enter into that Covenant which they had paſſed upon their own people. By this accident that part of the Nation that was engaged in that unnatural War, of the Parliaments ſide, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by the <hi>Scotch</hi> Presbytery. But after the <hi>Covenant</hi> was thus impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, they ſtill retained the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, filled the Town with Proteſtations and Remonſtrances againſt the Kings feared Murther; declared out of their Pulpits againſt the Actors of that deteſtable Tragedy; were continually contriving to reſtore our preſent King
<pb facs="tcp:50667:19"/> to the Government of his Kingdoms; and of their inſtrumentality in his Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the King himſelf is very ſenſible.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh the Church too were made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the extinction of that prejudice the Scotch Covenant created againſt her; for though God be thanked ſhe hath ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived almoſt all of thoſe deluded Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters, yet the apprehenſion of the danger, or the remembrance of the evil, at leaſt, will return with the mention of that name, and render it very diſpleaſing. I wiſh, I ſay, that prejudice was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by their frank Declaration of their good liking of her Order in general; and by their humble deſires to be ſpared in the matters whereof they yet remain in doubt, by the indulgence of the Church: That we may not incur the danger of looſing our Religion and Government, by the ſcandal that is given to the Church-men at the old remembrance of what hath been done here by ſome that were of the Presbyterian Name.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:19"/>
                  <p>For this matter of Offence they of the Popiſh Faction do with mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to their Villainous deſign culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and improve. They ſtigmatize all that oppoſe the Popiſh Plot, with the Name of Presbyterians, and thereby would denote them Enemies of our Church-Order.</p>
                  <p>By this means they have brought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, too many Eminent men of our Church to at leaſt a dead Neutrality, as if things were come to this paſs, that they muſt periſh either by that or the Popiſh Faction, and had nothing left them to do, but to chuſe which way our Church ſhall be deſtroyed: A cold comfort this would be, that whatever way they ſhould take, they muſt aſſiſt to the deſtruction of their Order.</p>
                  <p>Upon this rock we are like to be ſplit, this makes our deliverance to ſtick in the birth, and upon this hinge the fate of our Religion and Nation will turn. Lord, what a prodigious thing is this, that
<pb facs="tcp:50667:20"/> is come to paſs in our age. <hi>Religion it ſelf muſt be the devoted thing to the rage and folly of the Prieſts of that Religion.</hi> Let them in the Name of God conſider what iniquity it is to declame againſt the faults of others, and not endure to hear of their own Crimes: To hate one-another for thoſe very proceedings that their own faults occaſion: where the fault is in both ſides, the fault is in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo as they may juſtly accuſe one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: and yet they will both fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a moſt ſevere Condemnation, to be ſure, in the next world, if they do not both miſs their aims, and be confounded with guilt and diſappointment in this.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh it were conſidered, that ſcarce any Nation ever yet periſhed, that was ſo blinded in her own concerns, that ſhe had not diſcerning men enough to have preſerved her from the deſtroying Evil, if many good and wiſe men did not perſwade themſelves, it was better to ſuffer it than to endeavour to prevent
<pb facs="tcp:50667:20"/> it: and from the fears of one Party, and the diſlike they have conceived againſt the other, determine with themſelves to ſtand Neuters, whilſt they want Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to oppoſe the dangers that one ſide threatens, and think the diſorders of the diſcontents incorrigible.</p>
                  <p>It was a wiſe Law of <hi>Solon, That if the Common-wealth at any time ſhould be divided into Factions, that the Neuters ſhould be noted with infamy;</hi> by which every man was obliged to take a ſide or Party; and all the virtuous, peaceable, and modeſt, were engaged to appear openly in the concernments of the Government: he concluded aſſuredly, that by this means Peace would be more eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, and terms of an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more readily invented and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Factious Knaves of both ſides turned out of Office, their Evil Deſigns diſappointed, and the ruine of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Extremities of wicked men prevented.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:21"/>
                  <p>For the worſt men are moſt forward in Factions, and the greateſt beautefeus moſt honoured by their reſpective con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Parties, before the wiſe and good interpoſe.</p>

                  <p>The Cauſes of the Differences would be better underſtood, be rendred clear and conſpicuous, when the honeſt men (ſuch as can have no intereſt but the publick good, whoſe Authority is more prevalent with the people than the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Reaſon) do declare them: and thoſe that are miſ-led and abuſed into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, would then unite and conſpire againſt thoſe who gave the firſt occaſion to the Diviſions, and promote them.

                     <hi>Borgia,</hi> they fell to agreement among themſelves, and made head againſt him their common Enemy.</p>
                  <p>If all that are true Proteſtants, and true lovers of our Government, would declare themſelves on the behalf of our Religion and Government, in ſuch terms as befit honeſt men, and as the Exigency of our preſent ſtate ſhall require; we ſhall find the numbers of Addreſſers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Dukes Penſioners &amp; Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The number of Phanaticks made ſo few, that the Papiſts would again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Fautors and Defenders of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm, as they were about ten years ſince, leſt the numbers of Fanaticks ſhould not be big enough to make a Scare-crow for the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Schiſm not conſiderable enough to diſgrace her.</p>
                  <p>All diſcerning men ſee, that the late Addreſſes have been obtain'd by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: That the deſign therein was to make Voices for the diſcontinuance of
<pb facs="tcp:50667:22"/> Parliaments, and for a Popiſh Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>If the people are pleaſed with theſe things, there is no wrong done them; and if we affect a change of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Government, it may be eaſily obtain'd.</p>
                  <p>The King hath no reaſon to conſent to diſinherit his Brother, if the People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the hopes of ſuch a Succeſſor, or at leaſt will acquieſce under that fate: but if we would avoid it, we muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate it in ſuch applications to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as conſiſts with true Loyalty, and with ſuch earneſtneſs as the matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; and at the ſame time repreſent the ſmalneſs of the numbers of Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, and the inconſiderableneſs of their quality. Thus his Majeſty would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand better the Senſe of his People, eſpecially when moſt of the Addreſſers themſelves ſhall, by joyning in ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, ſhew what they meant by <hi>Lawful Succeſſors</hi> in their Addreſſes:
<pb facs="tcp:50667:22"/> And that when in the ſame Addreſſes they did engage to ſerve the King with their Lives and Fortunes, they did not intend to ſubject themſelves and all that they have, to his Majeſties abſolute pleaſure. In that they thank his Majeſty for his Promiſe of frequent Parliaments, they deſire them; and when they thanked him for his promiſe to maintain the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, they deſired the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of it, and ſuch a Law as is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for its preſervation. Then it may appear that the Abhorrers themſelves did not underſtand that the name of the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> in the buſineſs of Abhorrence, is but like the name of <hi>John a Styles</hi> and <hi>John an Oaks,</hi> of <hi>Titius</hi> and <hi>Sempronius,</hi> in putting a fictitious Caſe: And that the onely Queſtion askt, was, <hi>Who are the moſt damnable Plotters at this time, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants or Papiſts?</hi> And that this was the Queſtion intended to be put to the People in the Sollicitation of <hi>Addreſſes of Abhorrence,</hi> is evident.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:23"/>
                  <p>If we did dutifully repreſent to his Majeſty theſe Proceedings, as the Arts of our Enemies for dividing us, and the Methods of our deſigned Ruine, we ſhould not be undone; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than this neceſſary for the preventing of our Ruine, ſince we have ſo gracious a King.</p>
                  <p>Our King is duly ſtiled, <hi>Pater Patriae;</hi> he will not ſuffer his People to be cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous (as no good Prince can ſuffer his to be) from any cauſe whatſoever that is to be removed; no, not from their own Fears and Jealouſies, if they are innocent, reaſonable, and probable. The Affections of a Prince to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſuperſede his Affection towards any private Relation: So ſtrong is the Tye of Duty upon him, from his Office, to prevent publick Calamities, as no reſpect whatſoever, no not of the <hi>Right Line,</hi> can diſcharge; nor will he himſelf ever think, if duly addreſſed, that it can.</p>
                  <p>By the Kingly Office, he is taken up
<pb facs="tcp:50667:23"/> from amongſt men, and is made a God to us; he is not to ſuffer the paſſions of a private man, ſo as to be ſwayed by them. In this high capacity. In the matters of the Government, nothing ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine him, but the Common weal, to which purpoſe all Governments are inſtituted.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the excellent humanity of our King, which hath made his Reign ſo clement, doth diſpoſe him to a tender Affection towards his People committed to his care, and muſt powerfully incline and perſwade him to do any thing that is neceſſary for preventing ſuch Evils; which as they are greater than can be ſupported by his People, ſo if they come upon us, we ſhall never be able to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge or recover from under their preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
                  <p>There wants nothing but a univerſal deſire of being happy, to make us ſo; and nothing but a declaring our ſteady abhorrence of the Evils we cannot ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain,
<pb facs="tcp:50667:24"/> is further neceſſary for preventing them: Our Enemies will be deſtroyed meerly by our uniting; they have no direct Strengths of their own, all their hopes and confidence is in our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
                  <p>We may evacuate their deſigne, by making it impoſſible, without a Conflict with any of the Evils fear'd: We ſhall have no Enemies from that time we are at peace with our ſelves; if we have courage enough to ſay we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to periſh, we are immediately ſafe. Our Traytors would diſappear, if we had no Neuters; and we cannot loſe either our Religion or Government, if we have a juſt concern for them. If the Proteſtants would in time underſtand that the ſingle Art and Stratagem they have to undo us, is by dividing us, we ſhould not aſſiſt it by receiving falſe and hated Characters of the ſeveral Sects that are amongſt us from the Popiſh Writers; and repreſent them to our
<pb facs="tcp:50667:24"/> ſelves as more deteſtable than the Popiſh Traytors, and alike Enemies to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It is no more agreeable to a ſcrupulous man about a Ceremony of the Church, to depoſe and murder his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prince, than to a man of a nice Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to be impiouſly wicked. Too true it is, all Nations and Religions have been ſometime or other ſtain'd with the horrid guilts of Depoſing and Murdering Kings, under a pretence of deſtroying Tyrants, and vindicating their Country from Oppreſſion. The Biſhops con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd with the Temporal Lords in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the ſecond <hi>Richard:</hi> In an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to that King they juſtifi'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves therein, <hi>Ex Antiquo Statuto,</hi> from the Conſtitutions of the Kingdom; and <hi>Ex facto nuperrimè dolendo,</hi> by which they meant the depoſing of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second. <hi>Knighton,</hi> one of the <hi>Decem Scriptores</hi> publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> gives us the Addreſs <hi>in terminis.</hi> Until the Collectors of Diſſenters Sayings can
<pb facs="tcp:50667:25"/> juſtifie the Biſhops in this matter, let them not trouble the world any more with the farrago of ſome of their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Sayings, thereof to make a Character of a Diſſenter: for it belongs no more to him, as ſuch, to be a Traytor or Rebel, than it doth to the Character of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Biſhops to depoſe their King, and cauſe his moſt Sacred Bloud to be ſhed and profan'd as a common thing.</p>
                  <p>But for removing the fears that our cautious Church-men have of Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which hath caſt them into a cold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency and inert neutrality at this time, when if ever the Applications of an active Prudence are required from all honeſt men, and lovers of their King, Country, and Religion, I wiſh they would weigh and conſider the miſchiefs on either hand: What the Popiſh Party deſignes, and what the Diſſenters would have: What powers the Popiſh Party have, what endeavours they uſe to force their Superſtitions upon us, and to
<pb facs="tcp:50667:25"/> change our Government: That the Diſſenters have neither Power nor Will to deſtroy our Religion or Government: They are already of our Church, and it is expected that they ſhould be Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to the Biſhops for their interceſſion towards obtaining ſome Indulgence in ſome little matters, that may bring them into an entire Communion with us. It may eaſily be known who are for the preſervation of our Government, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of it, by their Deſires or Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrences of Parliaments; (and who deſires Parliaments more than Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?) which would preſerve our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Government in Church and State, and the true Religion eſtabliſh'd among us, and recover us into a firm Peace and Union, by juſt and neceſſary proviſions for their ſupport. Whilſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is preſerved, the Church is ſafe and ſecure: for no man can fear that the King and the States of the Realm will ever give place to wild Fanaticiſm, and
<pb facs="tcp:50667:26"/> ſuffer ſo excellent an Eccleſiaſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as we enjoy, to be ſubverted, for any Extravagancies that ſhall deſerve the name of Fanaticiſm. But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of our Neuters for their Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are not more groundleſs than their reaſonings are abſurd, by which they oppoſe the only remedies to the Evils that now beſet us, and the greater we fear.</p>
                  <p>That abſurd Opinion, <hi>Dominium fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur in gratiâ,</hi> is charg'd upon thoſe that are for the Excluſion of the Duke; and they think by pronouncing this piece of abſurd Latine, they have at once put to ſilence and ſhame all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Nature, Religion, and State, that urge it and require it.</p>
                  <p>That there is nothing can be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd than that <hi>Dogma,</hi> will appear, for that almoſt whole Dutch Syſtems of falſe and paltry Theology go to the making of it, in the moſt tolerable ſenſe it can have; and for that it hath been
<pb facs="tcp:50667:26"/> improv'd into a moſt villainous ſenſe, to give countenance to the vileſt Outrages of the <hi>German</hi> Anabaptiſts.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Dominium</hi> ſignify'd Property, not Government and Rule, until our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably accompliſhed young Divines of this laſt Age, out of their great skill in the Latine Tongue, would have it ſo, for the ſervice of the great Defender of the Proteſtant Religion, and of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All Rights, as well Natural as Civil, are forfeitable by Crimes, in ſuch meaſure and degree as Laws appoint, and as good Government requires: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Grace</hi> be not admitted a good Title to any thing that the Saint will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, though of the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtamp.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, Natural Rights, (but they are very few) are not controlable by Laws, but are by Laws to be defended, and the free uſe of them to be juſtifyed and allowed, moſt certainly not to be condemned by any Civil Authority.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:27"/>
                  <p>A right in Nature every man hath to live, until he hath forfeited his Life. Whatever he doth that is neceſſary for his preſervation, is and ought to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by all Laws, though he kills, though he breaks the Civil Incloſure of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which cannot, and was never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhut out the Natural Right that every man hath in the laſt extreamities. Every man hath a right to his plank in a Wreck, though the owner of the Ship periſh by him for want of it.</p>
                  <p>All the Authority of all the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in the world united, cannot make unlawful any Act that is done in ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation: <hi>Sub moderamine inculpatae tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telae,</hi> where the man is innocent.</p>
                  <p>But Civil Rights are without iniquity alterable and controleable by Laws, and by acts of Government ordainable to the publick good.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is ſo intirely, perfectly, and abſtractly Civil, as Government, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Creature of men in ſociety, made
<pb facs="tcp:50667:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> by pact and conſent, and not otherwiſe, moſt certainly not otherwiſe: and therefore moſt certainly ordainable by the whole Community, for the ſafety and preſervation of the whole, to which it is in the reaſon and nature of it intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſign'd.</p>
                  <p>But we are told by ſome, that will not conteſt the lawfulneſs of <hi>Excluſion,</hi> That we trouble our ſelves with the fears of an imaginary danger: That we are endeavouring a remedy againſt the Evil that may never happen: That we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently trouble our ſelves about pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding that which we may never want or need: That the Duke may dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King: And if the Duke ſhould ſurvive, he neither can nor will change our Religion: That it is not lawful for any man, <hi>Occupare facinus quod timet,</hi> and to deſtroy the perſon whom he fears.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh it were conſidered on the other ſide, That if the Duke dye before the King, there is no wrong done to the
<pb facs="tcp:50667:28"/> Duke by Excluding him. It is onely his hopes and expectations that are cut off, for the preventing our fears; a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of hurt provided againſt, by ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the poſſibility of effecting it; and that not by any hurt to his Perſon, but meerly by diſabling it: a Remedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned and ſuited to the diſeaſe: we deſire to be eaſed of our fears, by a juſt ſecurity againſt them. But if the Duke ſhould certainly ſurvive the King, and could and would change our Religion, they who thus diſcourſe, ſeem to allow it lawful to exclude him. But for that they ſay the Duke, if King, will not or cannot change our Religion: let every man conſider his preſent Will and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and how far he hath proceeded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, before he is entred into his Kingdom. Theſe ſilly dreamers diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, whilſt they pretend to ſerve him. His Princely Virtues make him the more dreadful to a Proteſtant King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. They who thus talk, make him
<pb facs="tcp:50667:28"/> a bad man of that bad Religion, weak in his conduct, and feeble in his power: But how can this be, when they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the Nation into abſolute obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and have meaſured the duty of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by the Kings pleaſure, and not by Laws: That the pleaſure of a King is irreſiſtable; ſome of them will not allow paſſive obedience to be at all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, all caution is proportioned to the greatneſs of the Evils feared. No wiſe man ever left the ſum of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to Chance. Where the Evils are not to be remedied or reſiſted when they happen, the caution is juſt that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents them. If there be no remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Evil we fear, but the Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Excluſion is not onely lawful, but commendable. And for this we have the Authority of the Illuſtrious <hi>Grotius,</hi> under his general Doctrine and determination, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>De Jure belli ac pacis.</hi>

                  <p>It is Engraven in Capital Letters up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Foundation-Stones of all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments in the world, That any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon unfit for Government, ſhall be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from Governing. Though Fools cannot read it until the foundations be removed, and the Government ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. That his Royal Highneſs hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf unfit for the Government, hath been declared more than once, by the unanimous conſent of all the States of the Realm; and how far the King hath been of the ſame opinion, may be conjectured by thoſe Expedients that have been offered in ſeveral Parliaments, by Privy-Councellors and Miniſters of State, and the Dukes greateſt Friends. Onely ſuch were thoſe of the late Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments that oppoſed the Bill of Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but even theſe were for ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Royal and Soveraign Powers and Authorities during the Life of a Popiſh Succeſſor, and to leave him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Name of a King onely.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:29"/>
                  <p>An Indignity this both to the Name and Office: a thing repugnant to the Fundamental Conſtitutions: This tends to deſtroy the Monarchy it ſelf: It points directly to the Evils of the late times, and would make the Parliament Sequeſtrators of the Crown.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch abſurdities thoſe that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red moſt his Friends would run us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather than a Popiſh Prince ſhould become our King: Such an abhorrence they themſelves had againſt the miſchiefs that would thereupon enſue to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Is it fit after this, that the lawful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to Exclude him, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a Proteſtant Plot; and thoſe that deſire it, for that reaſon onely, accounted Enemies to the Government, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigners to change it? What madneſs is it, that his arrival amongſt us ſhould be welcomed with any tokens of joy! That Addreſſes ſhould be made in his favour! That we ſhould court that miſchief, that
<pb facs="tcp:50667:30"/> the wiſdom of all our Eſtates in ſeveral late Parliaments have conſulted how to avoid. To turn ſo fond of a Popiſh Succeſſor, as to be content to quit our Parliamentary Conſtitution, our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for his ſake: for his ſake we have had Parliaments Diſſolved, and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence will not give us leave to hope for a Parliament.</p>
                  <p>But let no honeſt man be affrighted and put out of Countenance with any Imputations or Reproaches of Sedition, whilſt he adheres to the Senſe of all the Eſtates in Parliament, and that which hath been in ſome ſort the Kings Senſe too.</p>
                  <p>They are the Seditious, that propound deceitful Expedients, which tend to change the Government, and to Embroil His Majeſties Kingdoms; who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Senſe of the States of the Realm; oppoſe the voice of Nature, and the common Senſe of the whole Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional world: That are contrary to the
<pb facs="tcp:50667:30"/> Government, and do, as much as in them lies, go about to diſſolve it, by leſſening the Powers of Parliament, exerciſed and declar'd in their Acts; and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Act of Parliament, 13 <hi>Eliz.

                  <p>Theſe therefore are the only Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers amongſt us againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> our Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Reformers, who brought us out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and out of the houſe of Bondage, who though dead, yet ſpeak, and their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity yet lives in our Laws, and is to be obey'd by us: we have no rules of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to our Prince, but the Laws, and the Authoritative Declarations of the Government, which are called the Kings Laws, and the Kings Will and Pleaſure (whenſoever they were firſt made) in all ſucceſſion of time. Theſe Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb facs="tcp:50667:31"/> are ſaying one to another, Let us make a Captain, and let us return into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and yet they rub their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads and ſay, that they are clear of the gain-ſaying of <hi>Korah</hi> and <hi>Dathan,</hi> and are not of the company of <hi>Abiram.</hi> Though if they will conſider the ſtory, they will find themſelves in that compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: for thoſe that were for a Captain to return into <hi>Egypt, Numb. Cap.</hi> 14. did continue their Murmurings, upon what enſued thereupon againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> headed by <hi>Korah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram, Numb. Cap.</hi> 16. and both are remembred as one offence, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106.</p>
                  <p>So miſerably do theſe men abuſe their Conſciences firſt, and then abuſe the Scripture to ſerve their turn. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable more than the unlearned, wreſt the Scriptures, to their own deſtruction. Theſe men againſt all congruity and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, do object the ſtory of <hi>Korah</hi> and his Accomplices againſt the Adherers to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and reproach them
<pb facs="tcp:50667:31"/> with the Names of thoſe Evil and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate men, who do what they can to hinder our return into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and are not for this Captain of theirs.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Quis tulerit <hi>Graccos</hi> de Seditione querentes?</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Theſe are the moſt dangerous Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, a moſt miſchievous ſort of Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans. The malignity of Puritaniſm is, to pretend to be more righteous than Laws. Where no Divine Law inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, but the matters are left by God to the prudence of Governments, and to their appointments and directions: to pretend Religion for their Schiſmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Separations: to diſobey their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, when they have no command of God againſt their injunctions, though they have no Law of God for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter injoyn'd. But the Church-Puritans have ſome pretence for their Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, becauſe Religion is certainly of Divine Inſtitution in the Subſtance and Eſſentials thereof: they pretend they keep
<pb facs="tcp:50667:32"/> cloſe to the Divine Inſtitution, and they at the worſt do but prepoſterouſly prefer Sacrifice to Obedience. But this Civil Puritaniſm which we complain of, is neither Obedience to God or man, nor yet Sacrifice. Sacrifice it cannot be, where Religion it ſelf muſt be the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctim; not Obedience, but an enormous and monſtrous ſort of Diſobedience: they diſobey not to pleaſe themſelves, but for meer miſchief to themſelves; theſe are ſinners againſt their own Souls with a witneſs. By departing from the Rules of Government, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to betray Gods true Religion, and the Government; and they muſt become either Rebels or Slaves, either Apoſtates or Martyrs. But Martyrs if they be, it will be rather of their folly than of Religion, and God will take no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Sacrifice of Fools.</p>
                  <p>The wickedneſs and folly of theſe men, ſeems peculiar to this preſent age; it ſeems prepared by the Divine <hi>Nemeſis,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50667:32"/> to puniſh our prevarications from the rules and obligations of that Religion, which we have diſhonoured by our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to believe it, that ſo it and we ſhould periſh and be extinct together; that we ſhould then pretend to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Inſtitutions of his Holy Religion, when we are in a courſe of utterly ſubverting it.</p>
                  <p>What impudent hypocriſie is this, to pretend to obey our Governours for Gods ſake, when they really are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Fundamental Conſtitutions of State, and by being ſo, aſſiſt to the Extirpation of Gods true Religion Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht amongſt us by Law! Laws can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be controul'd by the Princes pleaſure; they oblige when his Perſonal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands do not. Kings cannot make their Governments other than an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſent hath made them; and ſuch we are obliged to continue them.</p>
                  <p>A man may neglect his own private right without fault, for in that he is onely
<pb facs="tcp:50667:33"/> accountable to himſelf. But the Rights of the Government, the Rights of the Community can never be leſſened or neglected in their uſe, when the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nation requires their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</p>
                  <p>Where we have a liberty or right to do an act, a ſupervenient neceſſity makes that act our duty. When the caſe occurs wherein that right is to be uſed, and for which that Authority was created, then they that have that right and that authority, are as much obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to uſe it, as if there had been an expreſs Law to injoyn them.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort, I wiſh the haters of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans would conſider for themſelves, as well as others, that there is an <hi>obedience of Faith,</hi> as well as of Manners, due both to God and our Governours. That our judgments are to be form'd by the rules of right Eſtabliſhed by Law, as well as our actions to be governed in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Laws commanding and enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:50667:33"/> them. By that Faith that every man owes to the Government, he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to defend the Conſtitutions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: they are more properly Covenants than Laws, which yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls ſo; they are the <hi>Communes Reipublicae Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiones.</hi> If we do not form our actions in agreeableneſs thereto, and comport with them in our judgments, we do not onely diſobey the Authority of Laws, but are alſo falſe Traytors to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by violating our publick Faith.</p>
                  <p>And now, O ye people fooliſh and unwiſe, ye ſtupid and perverſe generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! will you ſtill perſevere to call that which is lawful, nay, neceſſary, nay, commendable and heroical, to which we are urged by neceſſity, to which we are obliged by the virtues of Religion to God, Loyalty to our King, the Faith that we owe to the Community, <hi>A do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Evil that Good may come thereof?</hi> Your own Condemnation muſt be juſt,
<pb facs="tcp:50667:34"/> if you be detruded amongſt the number of ſtupid Sots, reckoned amongſt thoſe that have loſt their Reaſon, extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed their Faculties, ſuppreſſed their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and have no other uſe of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon left them, but what is to betray them to greater Evils, as a juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their former abuſing it. You perverſely and abſurdly miſ-apply words without ſenſe: To the purpoſe that you may give countenance to your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, your utter neglect of Gods true Religion, the ſafety of your Prince, and the publick peace, and become Traytors to God, your King and Countrey, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſenſe or remorſe.</p>
                  <p>I have but one Obſervation to make, and one word of my ſelf, and I ſhall conclude.</p>
                  <p>The Obſervation is this: Scarce any Government hath been inteſtinely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but its deſtruction was from it ſelf; which could never have hapned, if the great men had not been guilty of
<pb facs="tcp:50667:34"/> connivance at, and ſufferance of Evils that might have been timely prevented. And for that after the long continued ſtupidity of the upper and lower <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> which are moved by nothing but what they feel; they have grown im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of the ſmart of thoſe Evils they could not, or would not foreſee. To this Hiſtories do give ample teſtimony, as they do alſo teſtifie, that Concuſſions in Governments, and Convulſions in State, proceed moſtly from Flatterers, incroachments of power, attempts upon the Government, and decay of Faith and Truſt in our Governours; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from Factious Demagogues. But theſe never appear, until the Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and Projectors upon Government have firſt played their tricks: they wait as Owls for the twi-light, and Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks for the winter; they are onely uſeful as revulſive remedies againſt the Evils of the other: but are without all manner of Grace, where the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:50667:35"/> is uprightly and duely Adminiſtred. And thirdly, and principally, from the frailty of Humane Virtue. When ſome of better place, for the preſervation of the Ancient Government, and Gods true Religion amongſt us, will not endure to forego or looſe ſome accommodations or advantages of life, which they may be well without, and perhaps do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; how can it be expected that the generality of Mankind ſhould ſuffer Martyrdoms in meer Loyalty, (that is) be contented to become miſerable and and calamitous, and have no other pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their miſeries and Calamities they ſuffer, but that their Prince receives therein an imaginary pleaſure, and a falſe ſatisfaction?</p>
                  <p>When all is ſaid, men will never go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern themſelves by the Doctrine of the ſevere Caſuiſts: But their virtue of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty will bear the ſame proportion as their other virtues do to the Canon of Morality.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:35"/>
                  <p>The beſt ſervice that can be done to any Government, is to keep it true to its own Conſtitution, good and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to the People.</p>
                  <p>To this all wiſe and good men ſhould in their ſeveral places apply themſelves with Heroical zeal, a buſie care, manly and firm reſolutions; and thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, if poſſible, thoſe Evils that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind will not endure and ſuſtain.</p>
                  <p>If all that were diſ-intereſted from any Faction, would interpoſe with wiſe applications to ſuch purpoſes, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would not be ſo eaſily diſſolv'd, and Nations rendred miſerable or ruin'd. If all that are illightned, and truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, would thus dutifully behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at all times to their King and Countrey, both Demagogues and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers would ſoon be aſhamed, confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and forſaken, both by Prince and People, and Governments be of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting continuance.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:50667:36"/>
                  <p>But that no man may wonder at my boldneſs, and the freedom I have uſed in theſe Diſcourſes, I have only this true account to give of my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>That Loyalty and Religion, and the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Peace of my Countrey, have therein entirely conducted my thoughts, and guided my hand. I have therein affirmed nothing but what is publickly known for truth, and which the Cauſe I defend requires to be ſaid. It is the Cauſe of our Government, Religion, and Nation, that I advocate: The Cauſe is pleaded in its proper Court, before God and the King, Angels and Men; no other <hi>forum</hi> can take Cognizance of the Cauſe. To this the Writers of the other ſide hath invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us by, appealing thereto with their Reaſons. I am free from any juſt imputation of malice and contumely againſt the perſon who is moſt concerned in the right diſputed: I have conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein his true Intereſt, which cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from the Peace and Happineſs of Three Kingdoms. Juſtice her ſelf will acquit me from having done any thing amiſs; and I cannot ſuffer in the Cenſures of honeſt and reaſonable men. In theſe Conſiderations I am encircled as in a brazen wall, ſafe and ſecure; for as for the fears of Rage and Injuſtice, they ſhall never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect me.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I Now render you my hearty thanks for your free advice you gave me, concerning the publiſhing of the Argument for the Biſhops Right of Judging in Capital Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in Parliament, and for aſſerting their civil Honours and Rights in the Government. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it hath given me an occaſion, both of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the moſt of the Inferiour Clergy from thoſe Imputations which you have remembred to me, and are commonly diſcourſed to their diſadvantage, whereby they have loſt their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem with the People; and alſo of rectifying the miſtakes of ſome (for their number is not great) who have given too much cauſe therein of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick complaints.</p>
                  <p>You diſſwade me from giving any aſſiſtance to the Rights of the preſent Biſhops, for that the Clergy out of whom the Biſhops muſt be made, have entertained Principles that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the Government. They affirm (you ſay) <hi>That it is in the Power of a Prince, by Divine Right, to govern as he pleaſeth; that the power of the Laws is ſolely in him; that he may, if he pleaſe, uſe the conſent of Parliaments to aſſiſt the reaſon of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50667:37"/> his Laws, when he ſhall give any, but it is great condeſcention in Kings to give a reaſon for what they do, and a diminution to their moſt unaccountable Prerogative.</hi> You ſay, <hi>That they are for a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Succeſſor and no Parliament, and do as much as in them lies, give up our Ancient Government and the Proteſtant Religion, the true Chriſtian Faith, to the abſolute will of a Popiſh Succeſſor, giving him a Divine Right to extirpate Gods true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſhed amongſt us by Law, and to evacuate our Government by his abſolute pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Government by a King and Eſtates of Parliament, is as antient as any thing can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred of the Nation. The attempt of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in all Ages accounted Treaſon, and the puniſhment thereof reſerved to the Parliament by 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. The conſervancy of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being not ſafely to be lodg'd any where, but with the Government it ſelf. Offences of this kind not pardonable by the King, becauſe it is not in his power to change it. This is our Government, and thus it is eſtabliſhed, and for Ages and immemorial time hath thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; a long Succeſſion of Kings have recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed it to be ſuch: And juſt now, when we are under the dread of a Popiſh Succeſſor, ſome of our Clergy are illuminated into a myſtery that hath been concealed from the beginning of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments to this day, from the wiſdom of all Princes and Miniſters of State; <hi>That any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Government, not derived from the King,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50667:37"/> and that is not to yeild to his abſolute Will, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, and againſt the Divine Right and Authority of Kings in the Eſtabliſhment, againſt which no uſuage or preſcription to the contrary, or in abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, is to be allowed. That all Rights are ambulatory, and depend for their continuance upon his pleaſure. So that though the Reformation was made here by the Government eſtabliſhed by Law, and hath acquired civil Rights not to be altered but by the King and the three Eſtates. Theſe men yet ſpeak</hi> (ſay you) <hi>as if they envied the Rights of their own Religion, and had a mind to reduce the Church back again into a ſtate and condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſecuted, and deſigned ſhe ſhould be ſtripped of her Legal Immunities and Defenſatives, and brought back to the deplorable helpleſs condition of Prayers and Tears; do utterly abandon and neglect all the Proviſions that God's providence hath made for her protection. Nay, by this their new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, they put it by Divine Right into the power of a Popiſh Succeſſor, when he pleaſeth, at once, by a ſingle indiſputable and irreſiſtable Edict, to deſtroy our Religion and Government.</hi> And theſe opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you ſay, they are the more inclined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain, for <hi>that they believe no Plot, but a Presbyterian Plot;</hi> for, <hi>of them they believe all ill, and call whom they pleaſe by that hated name, and boldly avow that Popery is more eligible than Presbytery; for by that they ſhall have greater Revenues, and more Authority and Rule over the Lay-men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50667:38"/>
                  <p>This is a heavy Charge, if true; but it is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table (I am ſure) but to a few, and not ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, as ſome malevolent men of the Popiſh Faction are induſtriouſly buſie to have it. For if it were, I confeſs it might choque the conſtancy, Reſolution and Zeal of the moſt addicted to the ſervice of the Church-men, and make them at leaſt very indifferent in their Concerns. For theſe miſtakes are ſo groſs and inexcuſable, that they ought, if they could periſh by themſelves, to be permitted to ſuffer the ſmart of their own follies, and to be corrected by the evils they are drawing down upon themſelves, with their own hands. They deſerve to ſuffer as betrayers of their own Country: To be proſecuted with greater ſhame and ignominy, by all of the Reformed Religion, than the <hi>Traditores</hi> were by the Antient Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Theſe their deſerting of the true Chriſtian Faith, being much leſs excuſable than their fault that deſerved that name, and of greater miſchief, as of deeper malignity.</p>
                  <p>How many of the Clergy-men are thus miſled we know not; but they ſeem many more than they are, becauſe they are moſt in view, and come often under obſervation, frequent publick houſes, and talk loud, becauſe they want the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Preferments.</p>
                  <p>But certainly, Sir, what you ſay to be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Opinions of ſome Clergy-men, is the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs now of the Papiſts to propagate.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Hoc Ithacus velit, &amp; magno mercantur Atridae.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50667:38"/>
                  <p>Theſe are agreeable to, and indeed make up the moſt modern Project and Scheme of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot.</p>
                  <p>Since the diſcovery of their firſt Deſign of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the King, and maſſacring of the Proteſtants, they have taken ſuch courage, by obſerving how little power we have to prevent their Deſign, that they have us in ſcorn, and in the vileſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>They now think that we are not worth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, but by our own hands; that we are not worthy of their trouble, or the charge of Executioners of their providing. How enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining is it to his Holineſs, to find the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the impregnable Bulwark of the Reformed Religion, eaſily fall into his hands, by the unpreſidented folly of ſome of her Sons, without the trouble of attacking her either by Force or Argument, which have hitherto wanted ſucceſs, and ſuch attempts always atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with diſhonour, and miſchief to his See. How pleaſant will it be to him to ſee us periſh, and our deſtruction to be from our ſelves! With this he will anſwer all the irrefragable Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of the Church of <hi>England</hi> for her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from the Communion of the Romiſh Church. Then he will ſay with triumph, our Church deſtroyed her ſelf, and periſhed by a <hi>Divine Fate,</hi> for her unwarrantable and Sacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Schiſm; for ſo he will call our <hi>Follies,</hi> and impute them to Divine infatuations. The
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50667:39"/> manner of our deſtruction will be a better Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and of more force againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Reformation, than all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of all the Doctors of that Church to this day.</p>
                  <p>For this purpoſe, ſince the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, it is, that Sir <hi>Robert Filmers</hi> Books were Re-printed together, and recommended by the Title-page and the Publick Gazet to our reading. Since the Diſcovery of the Plot, we have had variety of Books Printed to the ſame purpoſe; <hi>viz To prove that all Kings, as Kings, are abſolute by Divine Right.</hi> Since the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, we have had men imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſearch all our antient Records and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to find out ſomething more antient than our Parliaments as now conſtituted, that it may ſerve as a pretence to take them away. Since the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, we have the memory of our late calamitous War revived, to raiſe a Panick fear of another, and to make the King believe that the genius of the Nation is Rebellious, and that the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion it ſelf is to be apprehended by Kings.</p>
                  <p>It is difficult to tell how that late unhappy War began, or how it came to iſſue ſo Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in the Death of the late King; though we know how it ended; <hi>viz.</hi> The Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered within twelve years after the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Death of that excellent King, into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50667:39"/> Loyalty; and in ſpight of a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Power, never before foil'd, ever victorious, then kept on foot for the Intereſt of a very few men, reſtored our preſent King (may his Reign be long and happy) to the Government of his Kingdoms, without the leaſt aſſiſtance of any of the Cavalier-party, and oblig'd a wary Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in the head of a factious and republican Army to Loyalty.</p>
                  <p>Nay, within that time alſo, the Nation had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered out of their partial Lapſe into Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, bred up great numbers of excellent Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, who maſtered the prejudices of thoſe times, were reverenced by the chief of the Presbyterian party, and are the beauty and ſtrength of the Church of <hi>England</hi> at this time.</p>
                  <p>The Presbyterians themſelves were grown reconcileable to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and had learnt by woful experience the miſchievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Schiſm, upon no better pretences than what then might have been ſatisfied and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated.</p>
                  <p>When the King and Church were reſtored, Fanaticiſm had expired, if ſome old peeviſh and ſtiff Church-men had not ſtudied obſtacles againſt an univerſal Accommodation, and ſome crafty States-men had not projected that the continuance of the Schiſm would be of great ſervice ſome time or other, to deſtroy the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and change our ancient Government; which is now apparently the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50667:40"/> Plot; and if ever it be affected, it will be with this trick of affrighting the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the apprehenſion of Fanaticiſm, and making them ſuſpicious of Parliaments. As many of them as are drawn into an opinion of the diſloyalty of our late Parliaments, the illuſions of the Popiſh Plot have paſſed upon them, and they are under the power of its faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. But both the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of the late Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and alſo <hi>how much it imports the Plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to have it believed that they deſign upon the preſent Government, will at once be clearly</hi> underſtood, if it be conſidered what hath been done for the forging of a Proteſtant Plot, (which was intended at the firſt opening to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Houſe of Commons), Things ſo wicked, as would make a virtuous man aſhamed of the Age he lives in. But after all endeavours to find witneſſes for their purpoſe, powerful encouragements, and great rewards, they have drawn none into their aſſiſtance, but who are publickly known for Rogues, or who wanted Bread, or had no Reputation to looſe. If the falſhood of this forged Plot had not been utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable, they might have procured bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeeming, and more credible witneſſes. They might ſure have found in this Age men bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, not already infamous, to have teſtified a probable Lye. But ſo neceſſary it is to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh deſign, that a Proteſtant Plot be believed, that they are not diſcouraged at the manifeſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50667:40"/> detection of their Conſpiracies, Perjuries and Subornations; but will ſtill go on as if they had a power to work miracles of villany for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is no better. Our modern Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians have been moſt obſervant agreeably to their virtuous make, how frauds, perjuries and violence have proſpered and ſucceeded in ſome particular caſes, and have brought about ſome deſigns; they imagine ſuch means throughly multiplied, to be able to conquer all things which they deſign. But theſe Arts, which have had ſucceſs by the permiſſion of God, when one Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain hath been to deſtroy another, will not paſs upon the Proteſtant Religion. Let them ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly in time deſpair, and give over ſuch enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes; <hi>For there is no Enchantment againſt</hi> Jacob, <hi>nor Divination againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the Lot of Gods inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and his peculiar Care.</hi> If <hi>Mordecai</hi> be of the Seed of the Jews, <hi>Haman</hi> ſhall fall before him. It is matter of comfort to us, and deſpair to the Plotters, that not one of their Plots yet, but hath proved abortive, or they have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated by their very ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, pray let it be obſerved how this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of leſſening our juſt confidence in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is otherwiſe carried on and promoted. It is now become the principal buſineſs of the Mercenary Writers for the Plot, to pick up and cull out all the enormities and irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe times, the <hi>Vitia temporum,</hi> and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of wild pranks of ſome beaſtly Fanatical
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50667:41"/> people, that exceed the common degeneracy of thoſe ill times into which the Nation by undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernable degrees ſo fouly lapſed, to make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of an ugly Vizard; and this they clap unduly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our fifths of the Nation, upon all that love and adhere to our Government and Religion, to render them ſuſpected of deſtroying again the Engliſh Monarchy and the Proteſtant Religion, even for thoſe very proceedings that they make for preſerving both. For the ſervice of Popery requires, that whatſoever oppoſes it, muſt be branded with Treaſon and Fanaticiſm; that ſuch delicate perſons as are fond of the name of Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though they underſtand not in what it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; that hate the name of Fanatick, ſince it is become as common a name of reproach, as the <hi>Son of a whore,</hi> though they underſtand not ſo well what it means, may be ſure ſo to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to be reckoned for Loyal and not Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, by taking the meaſures of the one and the other, according to the new notion of the Plot-Writers, and ſo become theirs with all their idle prattle. But let them make their beſt of this fooliſh ſort of men, if that was all they could effect by this project.</p>
                  <p>But they deſign further upon the Nation, <hi>viz.</hi> to match the fears of Popery, with a fear as great of the like Evils to thoſe of Forty one; as if theſe Plotters had power by their intereſt to raiſe a new War, when we have power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in our Government, if it were exerted,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50667:41"/> to deſtroy them by Juſtice. But theſe State-Mountebanks think it convenient, becauſe the Nation was caſt into a Frenzy in Forty one, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, when in perfect health, we are to be caſt into a Lethargy to prevent our relapſe; and in the mean time they intend we ſhould periſh inſenſibly and quietly, that way they deſign to deſtroy us.</p>
                  <p>It is ſince the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, that Popiſh Mercinaries have been hired to write virulent Libels againſt the Church, and bitter Invectives againſt Fanaticks. Out of the ſame Mint came a villanous Libel, called <hi>Omnia Comeſtia a Belo,</hi> againſt the Church, apt to render the Church-men ſuſpicious of another deteſtable Sacriledge deſigned; and that loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Print entitled the <hi>Committee,</hi> or <hi>Popery in Maſquerade.</hi> Many parts whereof hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon of belief, but that they have been the Subject of ſome drunken Rhimes in former times; but it is in the whole an inſufferable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt the Nation, by its application to this Age.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Mercinaries are the Authors as well of treaſonable Libels againſt the King, which they form ſo, as they may ſeem to come from the Fanatick party, to render the King jealous of them, as they are of the Libels againſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and their proceedings, to breed miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings between the King, Parliament and People.</p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50667:42"/>
                  <p>It is ſince the Popiſh Plot was diſcovered, that Fanaticiſm is repreſented more intolerable than Popery: That the Popiſh Plot, evident to the ſatisfaction of the King and ſeveral Parliaments, and of our greateſt Judicatures, is yet told us not to be ſo certain, as that the Fanaticks are Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in their hearts, though they own no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as the Papiſts do, that warrant Treaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable practices. And theſe Mercenaries, as frankly as if they had for the dividing of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Warrant ſo to do, call all Fanaticks that oppoſe Popery, deſire Parliaments, and expect they ſhould uſe that power that is lodged in them, to keep out Popery, and preſerve our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to bring to puniſhment thoſe wicked men that have notoriouſly deſigned to deſtroy it. The belief of the Popiſh Plot, in the mean time, is by ſcoffs and paltry Rhimes permitted publickly to be ſung in the Streets, put out of Countenance, and thoſe that believe it expoſed as a ſort of credulous Fools, or deſigning Knaves.</p>
                  <p>Such a vile eſteem the Papiſts now have of us, that they proſecute us with their ſcorn, and uſe us as if we were below their hate. They think our diviſions, which they have made, have already deſtroyed us; and they now hire a ſort of <hi>Scaramouchy Zaneys, Merry Andrews</hi> and <hi>Jack-Puddings</hi> to inſult over us, and make a ſport at our miſeries.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:50667:42"/>
                  <p>Theſe pleaſant Knaves cry with one ſide of the Face, and laugh with the other; but in the mean time they cry in jeſt, but laugh in good earneſt. He that had the art of imitating a grave Spaniard with one ſide of his body, and a brisk <hi>French</hi>-man on the other ſide, rendred both Nations ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>Theſe vain fellows deprave every thing they meddle with; and whatever they ſay of Church or State, Religion or Policy, is raillery and abuſe, and Pamphleting ſcurrility.</p>
                  <p>Lord, under what ſeeming fatality do we labor, that it can be thought to the Service of the Church or State, to employ ſuch Knaves!</p>
                  <p>We are uſed like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> bound, and our Eyes put out, and made ſport for the <hi>Philiſtims.</hi> By theſe py'd Pipers, our young men are ſeduced, and danc'd down a precipice; though theſe merry Knaves have not skill enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them for Rat-catchers, if our City ſhould be infeſted with that vermin, as they ſay the Town of <hi>Hammel</hi> once was. But the Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that appeared there a py'd Piper, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd their Children as well as their Rats, was not more miſchievous to that Town, than theſe motley Knaves are to the Kingdom and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>It is an inſufferable indignity, That the tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gical State of our Nation ſhould become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt daily the matter of a Raſcally Farce; the very anguiſh and groans of the Nation turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50667:43"/> into Laughter and Mockery, ſuch a barbarity was never uſed to a Nation.</p>
                  <p>It is an exceſs of Petulency, to make abſtract miſery in the very form of it, mimically repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented matter of Mirth and Laughter.</p>
                  <p>Theſe men were born out of time, and were fit for no Age but that of <hi>Nero,</hi> of whoſe conſort they ſhould have been, when he played the <hi>Deſtruction of Troy,</hi> to the Burning of <hi>Rome.</hi> But I do not doubt but His Majeſties Juſtice will e're long overtake the Incendiaries, that are ſo pleaſant at the embroilment of his Kingdom, when it ſhall be duly repreſented to him what beautefeus they are, and unmerciful deriders of the Calamities of his People, which they occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or promote. Tho they think they may paſs any thing of this kind upon the Nation, made vain with trifling falſe wit and Buffoonery.</p>
                  <p>It is now Twenty years ſince our Nation was infected with this ſort of wit, and now we are to dye of the diſeaſe. We have a Fiddle provided for us that have been bit with this venemous <hi>Tarantula,</hi> to dance and frisk us to our deſtruction, not to our cure; and yet we pay the Fidler.</p>
                  <p>This thing Wit, the greateſt debauchment of this Age, hath depraved not only the Manners, but the Judgment and Underſtanding of the Nation too. It hath been accounted the beſt accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men in place, the beſt part of the Learning of this laſt Age: It is not the reaſon of the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> ſo much as the vanity of Wit,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50667:43"/> that hath propagated Atheiſm, and corrupted our Manners. This hath made our Judgments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſincere and trifling; our determinate reſolutions in matters of the greateſt moment, ſlight and Phantaſtical; introduc't idleneſs and neglect of ſolid Learning, which requires labour and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to obtain, while this extemporary faculty has been accounted an admired accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſort of Wit very commendable, which <hi>Tully</hi> calls <hi>celeritas in verbis,</hi> and the Greek Epigram, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is a pleaſant entertainment in converſation, and a commendable refreſhment, where our minds are tired with anxious and graver buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the troubles and cares of humane life; but this ought to obſerve its times, its proper ſubjects, it ought to be confined to Table-talk an evening-compotation, and the hours of mirth, and the relaxation of our mind: It may be uſed decently in a Comical Farce; but it is not allowable in <hi>Satyr,</hi> moſt undecent is the uſe of it in Tragedy. But yet it hath inſolently interpoſed in our Politicks, governed publick Councels, ſometimes determined debates in Parliament; hath made our Pulpits contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, our Theology trifling: It is admitted to reſolve the greateſt Queſtions, and determine Caſes of Conſcience, to eſtabliſh and refix Church-Government; hath uſurped an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to alter and pull down Governments, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50667:44"/> to render them tottering, when they are as firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſht and fixt as a Rock.</p>
                  <p>That Wit that is abhorred by all men that are wiſe and honeſt, is that verſatile ſhifting, ſquinting, diſtorting of the Underſtanding, that it views nothing truly, and repreſents things not according to their true nature, but under falſe Fantaſtical Schemes, which they affix to them, to abuſe the judgments of others: a man can never arrive to any perfection in this faculty, until he is become falſe, and loſt his truth and modeſty: none but weak men are entertained with it, and ſuch who do not deſire to underſtand truth, but to ſerve a turn, and love to be deceived, and who deceive themſelves for advantage. It is in perfection in old Knaves, and admired by young Coxcombs. It is the Hypocriſie of the Tongue, a plauſible mode of lying and ſlandering; and at beſt, but a pleaſant Knavery.</p>
                  <p>It will render ridiculous or culpable, by falſe repreſentations, the moſt noble and heroical a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and put falſe colours upon moſt deteſtable Villanies. It can diſcredit a man by honouring him, and make a thing incredible by the very mode of believing it; making a man ridiculous, it concludes him at the ſame time unworthy; and to confute the moſt avowed Truths, there needs no more than to raiſe a ſit of laughter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; which has the ſame effect with the men of wit, and their vain admirers, as reducing a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50667:44" rendition="simple:additions"/> falſe propoſition to an abſurdity: Thus the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Age is governed by our riſibility. The Popiſh Writers have thus tickled us with their Wit, that we are ready to dye and periſh laughing, and we know not, nor care to conſider or judge of what does truly concern our preſervation. And by improving the vanity of ſome youngſters, they have drawn them to queſtion the Truth of the Popiſh Plot; and ſome can believe every hour of the day, when they meet with a merry Popiſh Pamphlet, that there is a Proteſtant Plot on foot; though they believe it, I am ſure, not much longer than they are reading it.</p>
                  <p>I will not grudge my pains in furniſhing a ſhort Demonſtration of the Popiſh Plot, ſince it is of ſuch importance to the ſaving of theſe men and the whole Nation, which poſſibly may fix their minds (notwithſtanding ſo vain they be) into a belief of it; which I have made ſhort, that it may be the better remembred; which I do in kindneſs to them, ſince it was lately (and may be ſo again ſhortly) a criminal matter to bring the truth of it into queſtion; and they are by all honeſt men reckoned as Plotters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who doubt it.</p>
                  <p>The Plot has been declared by the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, and four Parliaments, one of them conſiſting of Penſioners and Dependents on the Court, which for eighteen years together, were giving Demonſtrations of their Loyalty to their Prince, almoſt forgetting the publick
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50667:45"/> Weal: A ſolemn National Faſt has been Indicted by the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Authority of the Kingdom, for averting the miſchiefs thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, and ſolemnly Celebrated by the whole Nation; in which, certainly, they did not mock God, and deride his Providence.</p>
                  <p>Many unparallel'd Villanies have been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for the ſtifling, concealing, and ſuppreſſing the diſcovery of it, which (however wicked the Papiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sect of baſe, falſe and degenerate Chriſtians are) we cannot without breach of Charity towards them, think they would commit cheaply, and without cauſe, and to no purpoſe. They have murdered a Miniſter of Juſtice, becauſe he had the knowledge of it, and left nothing undone that they thought neceſſary to Aſſaſinate another for ſtrenuouſly oppoſing it. They have attempted upon the Lives of our Witneſſes. By perjuries and forgeries they have endeavoured to charge them with the moſt infamous crimes, to deſtroy them in their Lives and Reputations too, in a form of Juſtice. They have attempted by fears and rewards upon the integrity of all our Witneſſes, to draw them to retract their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony againſt the Plot; for which ſome of their Agents have been judicially cenſured; One Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to the Pillory, Fin'd 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to a years impriſonment: ſo evident and notorious was his offence, and by the Court thought ſo heinous, that it provoked the paſſion of the Court, and they ſeemed to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50667:45"/> exceed the ordinary Rules of Juſtice, for that they judged the Caſe to be of an exorbitant and tranſcendent nature.</p>
                  <p>The Plot of the <hi>Meal-Tub</hi> is a ſublimated piece of wickedneſs, the laſt accompliſhment of villany; it hath out-done all former, and Will never be out-done in after-Ages. The Papiſts by the Diſcovery of the firſt Plot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs hopeful in a Maſſacre, and of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their purpoſe by force: They dare not now kill the King, for that the World would not now believe it to be done by Mr. <hi>Claypole</hi> and his feigned accomplices; which muſt have born the blame from the Papiſts, and he and they long ſince Executed as Traitors, if that part of the Plot againſt the Kings Life had not been prevented by being detected.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, the firſt deſign of the Plot being rendered leſs feaſible by the diſcovery; They keep the King alive with care, as well for their avoiding the rage of the Nation, as to leſſen the credit of the Plot: But contrive to deſtroy as many as they thought fit to be Maſſacred, in form of a legal proceſs, and to charge them with a deſign of raiſing Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt the King. They had made a Liſt of a great number of conſiderable perſons, whom they intended to charge, principal Nobles and worthy Gentlemen about the Town; had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared witneſſes to ſwear the charge againſt them, and would certainly with more eaſe, after the firſt Conviction and Execution, have ſworn all that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50667:46"/> they had a mind to deſtroy into the ſame guilt. And thus all the truly Religious, the Noble, Good and Virtuous of our Nation, that had courage enough to own, aſſert and defend the true Chriſtianity, and our Government, muſt, to the eternal diſhonour of our Nation and Religion, have ſuffered the execrable death of Traitors.</p>
                  <p>We have reaſon to think them humane, when they onely deſigned a <hi>Gun-powder Treaſon,</hi> or a Maſſacre. Our abhorrence of this uſage diſchargeth in us all reluctancy to Martyrdom: Let them bring us to the Stake as Martyrs, then we ſhall bear our Teſtimony to the truth of the beſt Religion, and our Lives will not be cheaply loſt; but by this means we muſt be forced to diſhonour this Religion by our deaths. By a Maſſacre or a Gun-powder Plot, the vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, cruelty and treachery of that Apoſtate Church, had been declared to all the World, and that falſe Religion, as well as the profeſſors of it, had been rendered deteſtable, for which end a good man would ſcarce refuſe to dye. But by this means they would have forced us to perſonate their own proper Crimes and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies, and diſhonour our own peaceable and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religion. A man of Honour prefers his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Life, and would redeem it by his Death: But by this means we were, though innocent, to loſe our Lives by diſhonour, and to faſten a ſtain upon our Memories by our death. The Prieſts, their impudent Lyes at their deaths,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50667:46"/> in denying the matters of the Plot, of which they were upon clear evidence Convicted and Sentenced, muſt have paſt for truths; and all our worthy men dying with proteſtations of their innocence, muſt to the everlaſting infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of our Religion and Nation, been account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falſe and impious at their laſt breath. There is no reaſon to be aſſign'd of the patience of God or Man towards ſuch miſcreants, but that they may have time to add one impiety to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until an eaſie vengeance triumphs over them.</p>
                  <p>And though this laſt mentioned Plot is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond all exception, their Faces are hardned, and they are not yet aſhamed; but they have ſince contrived and ſuborned Witneſſes to ſwear the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſcovery of the firſt Plot to be a falſe contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of a Plot againſt the Papiſts. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they ſuborned a Son by perjury to commit parricide againſt his Father; this the greateſt Sin againſt Earth, the other the greateſt affront againſt Heaven. What a Religion is this, that muſt be thus ſupported!</p>
                  <p>Nay, as if they did not fear or care to looſe the favour of their moſt indulgent Prince, which they have poſſeſt ſince he uſed Papiſts in making his eſcape at <hi>Worceſter;</hi> they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived theſe two laſt Plots with ſuch Art, as to bring them under his Majeſties Obſervation, and repreſented them as things fit for his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. Sure if they were not urged
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50667:47"/> with the fears of a real guilt, and a reſtleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the Plot, they would never have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured thus to have intereſted the honor of the King, and to tempt him to abandon them to the publick Juſtice of the Nation; which begins to grow impatient, by the delays of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Helliſh Plot.</p>
                  <p>For we have had four Parliaments diſſolved ſince the Diſcovery of it, one a darling to the Crown. The bringing into queſtion the Diſſolution of that Parliament in the Houſe of Peers, upon the reaſon of an unnatural Prorogation, was not long before cenſured, and ſome great Lords impriſoned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; proceedings ſo unwarrantable, that it was after thought fit by that Houſe to obliterate the Memory of them; ſo neceſſary was that Parliament then thought to the ſervice of the Crown. The Diſſolution of that Parliament, gave us reaſon to fear that the King had no more buſineſs for Parliaments. By theſe Diſſolutions, no publick ends that are intelligible are ſerved, no Intereſt but that of the Plot is gratified; no perſons of any ſort receive their ſatisfaction but the Plotters, who are reſpited thereby from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Juſtice, and gain time to bring their Plot to effect.</p>
                  <p>This is the end the Papiſts have ſerved; but the King our great Phyſician of State, had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon that hath g<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ned him: for he knew the ſtrength of the Pl<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>, our Diſeaſe, and that a Diſeaſe that is dangerous, is ſometimes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50667:47"/> to be palliated, until the ſeaſon comes to make a thorow Cure; for it many times kills the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to precipitate the Criſis. All theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the Plot are paſt under every mans obſervation.</p>
                  <p>But that we know ſo little of it after all this time: It is now above three years ſince the firſt diſcovery. That the Plotters now ordinarily eſcape Juſtice. That a great Judge did abate his firſt Zeal in puniſhing the Plot, leſt he ſhould exaſperate it; and Reaſon of State might thus require it. Theſe things prove the greatneſs and ſtrength of the Plot, as well as the reality of it; theſe declare the Plotters intereſt is great, that the Plot is yet unbroken, ſtanch and hopeful.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we are not to believe our ſelves well, and live <hi>fine Regimine,</hi> as the Phyſicians ſay, but to expect, addreſs to, and deſire our Cure.</p>
                  <p>That the Papiſts think it yet hopeful, is evident from the Prieſts and the Lawyer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring their guilt with their laſt breath. We had the honeſt Confeſſions of the Convicted Prieſts and other Traitors of the Popiſh Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of which they ſtood Convicted, in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> and in the time of King <hi>James,</hi> of the Gun-powder Treaſon. What then could induce our Plotters Convict, to utter moſt ſolemn Perjuries the next minute before they were to appear to God? nothing ſure, but that they then hoped that the Plot might
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50667:48"/> be executed; they did it for the intereſt and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of their Church, and for the better bringing that Plot to effect for which they dyed; and for which at their deaths, to conceal, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured Heroically upon lyes and perjuries; which if confeſſed, would have been fruſtrated and become Abortive: For it muſt not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that even that Church is ſo degenerate, as to permit and allow men to ſuch impieties, for the punctilio's of honor, though of the Church it ſelf. But while they are not done for the ſake of him that commits them, but for an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant intereſt of their Church, (ſuch as the carrying on of this Plot) they ſay they looſe their nature by the direction of the intention, they become a pure piece of mortification and ſelf-denyal, an adventure to truſt God in what they do for his ſake, and for his ſervice; and their Caſuiſts will no more call them in this Caſe lyes or perjuries, than <hi>Abraham</hi>'s offering up his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> (though that was at Gods expreſs command) was murder. But the God of Truth, that God who hath declared, that when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any entercourſe with Mankind interpoſeth an Oath, that the matter under that Oath is ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revocable, peremptory and abſolute, cannot li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe or diſpenſe with perjurious falſhoods for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny end whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt remark one thing more, and that is, touching the credit of Dr. <hi>Titus Oats,</hi> and Capt. <hi>William Bedloe,</hi> viz. That they have been
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50667:48"/> incurious in their converſation, have followed their own natural courſe, allowed themſelves in their paſſions, have been apert and unreſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, have not cared who they offended, have ſought no mans favour, ſeem to care for no mans opinion, have valued and ſupported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only by their veracity, and have ſeemed to ſet all the world at defiance to find a flaw in their evidence, and have had little of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or eſteem, but for the ſake of their diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Beſides that ſo long a time hath not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a poſſibility, by all the Artifice, Intereſt and unhallowed frauds of <hi>Rome,</hi> to falſify any one part of that evidence. But numberleſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents have given credit and authentickneſs to their Teſtimony. Did ever any feigned Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony bear it ſelf up with ſo much Confidence, Bravery and Aſſurance? was there ever any falſe witneſs that did not endeavour to render himſelf acceptable, to beſpeak favour, which draws after it credit, and to appear of the moſt unexceptionable behaviour? Their faults and imprudences, ſuch as they have been, we would not have wanted, to make their evidence beyond all exception.</p>
                  <p>The undoubted truth of their evidence alone, hath given them the civil reſpect of all honeſt men, and will give the Doctor the publick ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Nation in due time. I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite the innumerable Sham-plots contrived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Proteſtants, every one of them a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50667:49"/> by it ſelf of the truth of the Popiſh Plot, becauſe I have no deſign to exaſperate, but awaken theſe men that are aſleep and ſecure in this ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>This trouble of demonſtrating of the Plot, may ſeem unneceſſary to the judicious, nay, to the plain ſort of honeſt, upright, and well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men; and ſo it would certainly have been, had not ſome young Gentlemen, by this paltry thing called Wit, been corrupted in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and brought into a Scepticiſm, and wild undetermination in a matter of ſo great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>This deſpicable faculty hath made a famous Gentleman, who hath a liberal Doſe of it, a Writer of Books, cauſed him to waſte ſo much Paper, and abuſe ſo many Readers; but in all that I have read of him, there is nothing true and ſincere, or truly and ſincerely ſaid; his Judgment is made falſe by his Phantaſie, or he hath ſerv'd a turn by his Verſatile windings and Wily conceits. That dangerous faculty that he indulgeth, hath impoſed upon him, which the ſevere and honeſt enquirers after truth are concerned to mortify and ſuppreſs. And I do earneſtly recommend to all ingenious Gentlemen, that would be rightly inſtructed and informed, neither deceive others, nor would be deceived themſelves, as they love truth and virtue, wiſdom and ſober thoughts, to deſpiſe this ſort of wit in others, and repreſs it in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50667:49"/> themſelves. And never allow it to be uſed, but in the hours of mirth, in the Relaxations of their minds from ſerious Contemplations and matters grave and weighty, where this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane thing <hi>Wit</hi> ought always to be ſhut out with care.</p>
                  <p>Enough hath been ſaid for rectifying the miſtakes of any true Proteſtant, eſpecially any Clergy-man of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which you have objected againſt them about our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Parliament, Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England</hi> and Popery. Eſpecially, when it is made apparent that theſe miſtakes are made ſerviceable to the Popiſh Plot, and the means which the Popiſh party proſecute to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs and bring about the ruine of our Church. But that nothing may be wanting, that lies in my poor power, for pulling their Foot out of the Snare, I ſhall more diſtinctly conſider them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall deſire them to conſider what our Government is, and where the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it is to be found. And where can it be found, but in our Statute-Books, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries of our Law, the Hiſtories of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and of the Kingdom? Search them if you be at leiſure; if you are not, conſult thoſe that have read them, and whoſe buſineſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment it is to underſtand them, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail to be informed.</p>
                  <p>That the King hath no power to make Laws,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50667:50"/> that both Houſes of Parliament muſt joyn with the King in making a Law.</p>
                  <p>It can with no more reaſon be concluded that the King hath the Legiſlative Power, becauſe his Aſſent makes the Bills in Parliament Laws, than it can, becauſe the third Unit added to two makes a Triad, that the other two do not go to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of that number.</p>
                  <p>When a matter's moved from the King in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to paſs into a Law, the Commons conſent laſt. The Letters Patents of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. for making the Eldeſt Son of a King in Succeſſion Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sir <hi>E. Cook</hi> 8. R.</note> was confirmed (as they muſt have been, otherwiſe they would have been void) by the Houſe of Commons.</p>
                  <p>And yet we will not ſay, that the Houſe of Commons can make a Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> or Duke of <hi>Cornwal.</hi> And yet upon no better reaſon than this, ſome men will talk as if they believed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that the Legiſlative power is in the King, when no King of <hi>England</hi> yet ever pretended to it; but by their proceſs of Law have puniſhed ſuch officious and miſchievous Knaves.</p>
                  <p>They alſo will tell you that, the Laws are the meaſures of our Allegiance, and the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and declare the terms of Obedience and Government.</p>
                  <p>That a Legiſlative authority is neceſſary to every Government, and therefore we ought not to want it; and therefore Parliaments, in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50667:50"/> which our Government hath placed the making of Laws, cannot be long diſcontinued, nor their Conventions rendred illuſory and in vain, which is all one as to want them.</p>
                  <p>That to Govern by Laws, implieth that great fundamental Law, that new Laws ſhall be made upon new emergencies, and for avoiding unſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable miſchiefs to the State.</p>
                  <p>By the Statutes of 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 14. 36 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. it is provided that Parliaments be holden once every year. The Statute of this King required a Parliament every three years; which being an affirmatory Law, doth not derogate from thoſe of <hi>Ed</hi> the 3. But if the King doth not call a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment once in a year, he neglects theſe Laws; and if he delays calling a Parliament three years, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glects the other Law of his own time too. And for that he is by the Law intruſted with the calling of Parliaments, he is at liberty to call them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the times appointed.</p>
                  <p>And that Laws ought to be made for Redreſs of miſchiefs that may enſue, appears by the Statute of proviſors, 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3 <hi>cap.</hi> 23. In which we have theſe words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whereupon the Commons have prayed our ſaid Soveraign Lord the King, that ſith the right of the Crown of</hi> England, <hi>and the Law of the ſaid Realm is ſuch, that upon the miſchiefs &amp; Dammage which happeneth to this Realm, be ought and is bound of the Accord of his ſaid People in his Parliament thereof, to make Remedy and Law in avoiding the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and damage which thereof cometh:</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50667:51"/> which that King agreed to by his Royal Aſſent thereto given.</p>
                  <p>I dare be bold to ſay, that never any Bill in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was loſt, and wanted the Royal Aſſent, that was promoted by the general deſires of the people.</p>
                  <p>If Popery therefore (which is the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that ever threatned this Kingdom) can be kept out by a Law, we ought to have ſuch a Law; and nothing can hinder ſuch a Law to be paſt for that purpoſe, but want of an univerſal deſire to have it. I deſire theſe Gentlemen to conſider, how they will anſwer it to our Saviour at the laſt day, if they ſuffer his true Religion, and the profeſſors of it, to be deſtroyed and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, when nothing but their deſires of a thing lawful to be had, and of right due, was requiſite to prevent it. Their ſufferings will be juſt and righteous from God, if their ſin occaſioneth it, and very uncomfortable to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The extent of the Legiſlative Authority, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where to be underſtood, but by our Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in which it hath been exerciſed and uſed, and by ſuch Acts that declare the extent of its power. By the 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. it is made. Treaſon during that Queens Life, and forfeiture of Goods and Chattels afterwards, <hi>To hold, maintain &amp; affirm, that the Queen by the Authority of the Parliament of</hi> England, <hi>is not able to make Laws and Statutes of ſufficient force and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, to limit and bind the Crown of this Realm, and the deſcent, limitation, inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Government thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:50667:51"/>
                  <p>And this authority was exerciſed by Entailing the Crown in Parliament in the times of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th, <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th, <hi>Richard</hi> the 3d, <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, thrice in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 8th. and upon the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> both the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were Entai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, whereby it was provided, that of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Children to be begotten upon the Queen, one was to have the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> another <hi>Spain,</hi> another the <hi>Low-Countries.</hi> The Articles of Marriage to this purpoſe were confirmed by Act of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are truly Loyal to our preſent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, have reaſon to recognize with high ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, that ſuch a power of altering and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting the deſcent of the Crown, is duly lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the King and States of the Realm: For under the Authority of an Act of Parliament of the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland,</hi> we derive our ſelves to the happineſs of his Government, and He his Title to the Crown of <hi>Scotland,</hi> which drew to him the Imperial Crown of <hi>England.</hi> For <hi>Robert Stewart,</hi> firſt King of <hi>Scotland</hi> of that Family, lived in concubinate with <hi>Elizabeth Mure,</hi> and by her had three Sons, <hi>John, Robert,</hi> and <hi>Alexander;</hi> afterwards he Married <hi>Eufame.</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Roſs,</hi> and after was Crowned King of <hi>Scotland:</hi> He had by her <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Earl of <hi>Athol,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> Earl of <hi>Straherne.</hi> When <hi>Eufame</hi> his wife died, he Married <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50667:52"/> Mure.</hi> After that by one Act of Parliament, he made his natural Children firſt Noble, that is to ſay, <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Carrick, Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Menteith,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Earl of <hi>Buchquhane.</hi> And ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by another Parliament, he limited the Crown in Tail Succeſſively, to <hi>John, Robert,</hi> and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> his Children by <hi>Elizabeth Mure</hi> in Concubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and after to the Children of <hi>Eufame Roſs</hi> his Legitimate Children; who are to this day in their Iſſue by this limitation, by authority of an Act of Parliament in <hi>Scotland,</hi> barr'd from the Crown; and we hope ever will be, by the continuance of the Line of our moſt Gracious King.</p>
                  <p>Note, that though a ſubſequent Marriage by the Civil Law, which is the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in ſuch caſes, doth Legitimate the Children born be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Marriage of a Concubine; yet it is with this exception, that they ſhall not be Legitimated to the prejudice of Children born <hi>afterwards</hi> in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and before the Marriage of the Concubine. Beſides, the reaſon of the Civil Law in Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the Children upon a ſubſequent Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> a preſumption that they were begotten <hi>affectu maritali;</hi> which preſumption fails, where the man proceeds to Marry another woman, and abandons or neglects his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine.</p>
                  <p>But I deſire theſe Gentlemen that are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to be ſafe in their Religion, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is moſt dear unto them,</p>
                  <p>That if any Law ſhould exceed the declared
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50667:52"/> meaſures of the Legiſlative Authority, though in ſuch caſe they may have leave to doubt of the lawfulneſs of ſuch a Law, yet if it be not againſt any expreſs Law of God, they will up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a little conſideration determine it lawful, if it be neceſſary to the Commonweal; for that nothing can be the concerns of men united in any Polity, but may be governed and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Laws of their Legiſlature for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good: for by the reaſon of all Political ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, there is a ſubmiſſion made of all Rights, eſpecially of the common rights of that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to the government of its own Laws.</p>
                  <p>But all this, and a hundred times as much, will not ſatisfie ſome Gentlemen of the lawfulneſs of our Government, and the extent of the Legiſlative power of Parliaments, ſince they have entertained a Notion, that Monarchy is <hi>jure divino,</hi> unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in its deſcent by any Law of man, for that it is ſubject to none. That all Kings are alike ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. That their Will is a Law to all their Subjects. That Parliaments and the States of the Realm in their Conventions, can be no more than the Monarchs Miniſters, acting under and by his appointment, which he may exauctorate and turn out of office when he pleaſeth: For there can be (ſay they) under the Sun no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Authority but that of Kings (to whom God hath given a plenitude of power) and what is derived from them. That this divine abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may govern, and exerciſe Royal Power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50667:53"/> and that it is not ſubject to, nor to be abated or reſtrained by any humane inventions or contrivances of men: (however neceſſary and convenient Kings have thought them in former Ages) by ſuch methods and ſuch Offices and Officers (of which number the States of the Realm may be, or not be, as Kings ſhall pleaſe) as they ſhall by their abſolute Will order or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. <hi>Our Parliaments,</hi> ſay they, <hi>are Rebellious, and an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation upon the unbounded power of Kings, which belongs to every King as ſuch</hi> Jure or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinario, <hi>and by Divine inſtitution: That a mixt Monarchy, as ours is, is an Anarchy; and that we are at preſent without a Government, at leaſt ſuch as we ought to have, and which God hath appointed and ordained for us: That we by adhering to the preſent Government, are Rebels to God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Kings unlimited Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity under him, which no humane Conſtitution, no not the Will and Pleaſure of Kings themſelves can limit or reſtrain, for that,</hi> jura ordinaria &amp; divina non recipiunt modum: <hi>That the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power is ſolely in the King, and that the buſineſs of a Parliament (if they would think of being onely what they ought to be) is onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare on the behalf of themſelves and the People (that ſend them for that purpoſe certainly) the obedience that is due from them to ſuch Laws as the King ſhall make, and that they may be laid aſide whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when he pleaſeth.</hi> And after all this, what matter's it with them what we ſay our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50667:53"/> is, hath been, or where the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Authority of the Nation is placed, or how uſed?</p>
                  <p>But I deſire theſe Gentlemen to conſider how they come to theſe Notions, upon what reaſon they are grounded. How a Government eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by God and Nature for all Mankind, ſhould remain a ſecret to all the wiſe, good, juſt, and peaceable men of all Ages. That Kings ſhould not before this have underſtood their Authority, when no pretences are omitted for increaſe of Power, and enlargement of Empire. I deſire them to conſider that this ſecret was not diſcovered to the World before the laſt Age, and was a forerunner of our late unnatural War; and is now again revived by the republiſhing of Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>'s Books, ſince the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh they would conſider, that the reaſons ought to be as clear and evident as Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that will warrant them to diſcoſt from the ſenſe of all Mankind in a matter of ſuch weight and moment.</p>
                  <p>That to miſtake with confidence and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening in this matter, will be an unpardonable affront to the common ſence of Mankind, and the greateſt Violation of the Laws of modeſty. I deſire that they would conſider, and rate the miſchiefs that will certainly enſue upon this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and whether a probable reaſon can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſupport it.</p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:50667:54"/>
                  <p>That they would throughly weigh, ponder, and examine the reaſons of theſe bold and new <hi>Dogmata.</hi> For their enquiries ought to be in proportion diligent and ſtrict, as the matter is of moment; and if they are not, their errour and miſtake will be very culpable, and the ſin of the errour aggravated to the meaſure of the miſchief which it produceth and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                  <p>Where is the Charter of Kings from God Almighty to be read or found? For nothing but the declared Will of God can warrant us to deſtroy our Government, or to give up the Rights and Liberties of our people. If they are lawful, I am ſure it is villany to betray them, ſince all Political Societies are framed, that all may aſſiſt the common Rights of all. I cannot imagine they can pretend an umbrage from the holy Scriptures for ſuch unheard-of Opinions.</p>
                  <p>The Jews indeed had a Government and Laws of Gods framing and appointment, and a King of their own chuſing; and ſuch a King as they deſired, by Gods permiſſion they had: But their form of Government ought with leſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be the rule of all kingly Governours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was a Government choſen by themſelves: then the Laws of the Jews ought to be the Laws of all Nations (which they are not) though made and enacted by God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt would not make himſelf a Judge in a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50667:54"/> private Right ſubmitted to him: He determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the right of the Roman Empire by the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Soveraign Authority; and ſuch as the whole world had made it, his Diſciples were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to acknowledge it, by their obedience and ſubmiſſions, which is the ſum of the Apoſtles Doctrine in this matter.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian Religion inſtituted no form of Governments, but enjoyns us to be obedient to thoſe we have, not onely by expreſs command in the caſe, but by its general Rules of a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, improved, and extenſive morality.</p>
                  <p>But though I ſaid the Scriptures have not preſcribed or directed any univerſal Form of Governments, yet the Scripture hath declared the falſhood of this new Hypotheſis of Kingly Government to be <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or by <hi>Divine Right:</hi> For St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.13 and 14, ſtiles Kings, as well as the Governours under him, the ordinance of man; which cannot have any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſence, but that men make them, and give them their powers. By St. <hi>Paul</hi> the power of Governments indeed is called Gods Ordinance, <hi>Romans</hi> 13.2. but that is for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in general God approves of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as neceſſary to the well-being of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, for the improvement of humane nature, for the puniſhing of Vice, encouragement and ſecurity of Virtue; without them it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to live honeſtly and in peace. And he hath made them the under-Miniſters of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:50667:55"/> and care over Mankind, and expects of them, that they ſhould promote his true Honour and worſhip in the world, which will be always accompanied with the exerciſe of all civil vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two different places muſt be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that they may be both true; and by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpretation can they be reconciled and made conſiſtent.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible that any thing can be of mans appointment, which is of Gods Ordination; there can be no ſuch thing as a Co-legiſlative power of Men with their Maker. Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is from God, as he hath made Governments neceſſary in the general order of things; but the ſpecification thereof is from men. The beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition that can be made of Government, is in the words of both the Apoſtles put together, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and ſuch Governments which men make, God approves, and requires our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them, upon all thoſe reaſons which make Governments neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The natural and eaſie conſequence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of theſe Scriptures, is this; which I deſire thoſe Gentlemen to obſerve: That whatſoever is not lawfully eſtabliſhed by men, no Law of God, not the Chriſtian Law, doth oblige us to obey.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian Religion doth equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, in the reaſon of its Inſtitutions, Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Contumacy. Where the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50667:55"/> us, that if we be free, we ſhould not become Servants, he hath by virtue of that Admonition, made it commendable not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the encroachments of Power over us. Moſt certainly therefore, as the Chriſtian Religion doth not prejudice the Soveraign Rights of Princes, ſuch as they are in the ſeveral Forms and Models of Monarchical Governments, <hi>non eripit terreſtria, qui regna dat coeleſtia,</hi> as <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulius;</hi> ſo doth it not enlarge them: when by the Goſpel God made us free from his own poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſure he did not intend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>de Jure,</hi> to render us Slaves to the Arbitrary pleaſure of men.</p>
                  <p>No man intends by any thing in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that all Mankind is obliged to any one Form of Government, and therefore all men are left to their own.

                  <p>To Obedience to Government, we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by as many ties as there are Chriſtian Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and he muſt diſown his Chriſtianity, that departs from his due Allegiance, And ſince our Saviour is declared King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, all Chriſtian Kings are to govern in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his mercy and goodneſs, and in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerviency to the intereſt of his Religion and Kingdom.</p>

                  <p>You your ſelves muſt needs condemn your ſelves to have forfeited all your own, who hold ſuch Principles that tend to deſtroy every mans Right, by reſolving all things into the abſolute pleaſure of a Monarch; in which you moſtly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the King, and are contrary to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties late Declaration.

I confeſs, if I could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this Doctrine was become Orthodox among them, and the prevailing opinion of the Clergie. I ſhould conclude us to be the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy people under the Sun. This is an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis indeed, that will bring on <hi>new Heavens and a new Earth;</hi> but ſuch wherein no Peace or Righteouſneſs can ever dwell. But I deem all ſuch as are Defenders and Promoters of it, do deſerve a civil Excommunication, more ſmarting than their Eccleſiaſtical: and to be condemned
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50667:56"/> to live upon, and onely feed themſelves with their thin and crude Speculations. To be excluded from any ſhare of that Government that they profeſſedly in their Principles betray. To be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as ſeditious perſons, and moſt miſchievous Schiſmaticks, far more intolerable in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, than the ſcrupulous Brotherhood, for their boglings at an indifferent and inſignificant Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony. For that to the ruine of our Religion, and deſtruction of the publick Peace, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide from that Polity, to which by drawing here their firſt breath, they made Faith; and to which the condition of their birth doth oblige them; they falſifie that which <hi>Arrian</hi> in his <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus</hi> calls the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, than which nothing is more ſacred and inviolable.</p>
                  <p>By creating themſelves a new Allegiance, and obtruding it upon their fellow-Citizens, and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſame Kingdom, they ſet up a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom within a Kingdom, more dangerous and miſchievous than the Papal <hi>Imperium in Imperio;</hi> which certainly will be introduced, if this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern and monſtrouſly-extravagant opinion can prevail by a general Credence.</p>
                  <p>It is criminal, and no leſs dangerous to the being of any Polity, to reſtrain the Legiſlative Authority, and to entertain Principles that diſable it to provide remedy againſt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſchiefs that can happen to any Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. No Government can ſupport it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an unlimited power, in providing for the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50667:57"/> happineſs of the people: No Civil eſtabliſhment but is controulable and alterable to the publick weal. Whatever is not of divine Inſtitution, ought to yield and ſubmit to this power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>The Succeſſion to the Crown is of a civil na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not eſtabliſhed by any Divine Right. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kingdoms have ſeveral Laws of Succeſſion; ſome are Elective, others Hereditary, under ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Limitations. All humane Conſtitutions are made <hi>cum ſenſu humanae imbecillitatis,</hi> under rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable exceptions of unforeſeen accidents and emergencies that may happen in humane affairs; and ſo they muſt be intended, and ſo interpreted. The ſeveral limitations of the deſcent of the Crown, muſt be made by the people in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Royal Dignity and Power, which is more or leſs in ſeveral Kingdoms. And the deſcent of the Crown in particular caſes, is governed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſumed will of the People; and the preſumption of the Peoples will, is made by meaſuring and conſidering what is moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the publick good; whereas private Eſtates are directed in their deſcent according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed will of the Decedents. And this is the reaſon tha<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the deſcent of the Crown is gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by other rules than private Eſtates. Onely one Daughter, and not all, as in private Eſtates, ſhall ſucceed to the Crown, becauſe the ſtrength of the Kingdom is preſerved when continued u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, and the peace and concord of the people
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50667:57"/> better eſtabliſhed. A ſon of the ſecond venter ſhall inherit, which is not allowed in private E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates; becauſe a ſon of the ſecond venter is equally of the bloud of the great Anceſtor, upon whom the Crown was firſt conferred by the people, or after he had got into the Throne obtain'd their Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and may equally participate of his virtues.</p>
                  <p>If the Royal Family be extinct, it belongs to the people to make a new King, under what limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations they pleaſe, or to make none; for the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is not deſtroyed if there be no King created; and conſequently, in caſe of this ceſſer or diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the <hi>Regnum,</hi> there may be Treaſon committed againſt the people. By all which it is evident, that the Succeſſion to the Crown is the peoples right: And though the Succeſſion to the Crown is Hereditary, becauſe the people ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it, would have it ſo, or conſented to have it ſo; yet in a particular caſe, for the ſaving the Nation, the whole Line, and Monarchy it ſelf, it may be altered, by the unlimited power of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Authority. We have been more juſt to the Royal Succeſſion, than the wonderful Sir <hi>Robert Filmer;</hi> for his Hypotheſes will not allow at all of Hereditary rightful Succeſſion: For he, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the right of the univerſal Empire of the World in <hi>Adams</hi> right Heir, ſince this Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath enlightned the world in this ſecret, no Succeſſor can, according to his Doctrine, derive any hereditary right from his Predeceſſor. His ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle can be only his own poſſeſſion; for no man can
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50667:58"/> claim by deſcent the Uſurpation of his Father, but he that is not conſcious to the wrong, and is <hi>bonae fidei poſſeſſor,</hi> under the preſumed right and title of his Father. I would be underſtood to ſpeak as the matter can be conſidered in a free reaſon, not under the prejudice of any poſitive municipal Law; for to ſuch Laws the right of Crowns, as the renowned Knight will have it, are not ſubmitted.</p>
                  <p>So that here in this matter their Knight fails them, and can give them no help. Their other friend, the great <hi>Leviathan-maker,</hi> is ſo far from eſtabliſhing an Hereditary Succeſſion, that he leaves Kings to be rightfully aſſaulted, depoſed, and deſtroyed by any perſon that can, who ſtands in danger of being deſtroyed by the King, though juſtly condemned to death; <hi>Leviathan,</hi> Part 2. cap. 21. <hi>Thoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a capital Crime for which they expect death, have the liberty to defend themſelves by Arms, as well as the Innocent.</hi> But I mention him onely to render him deteſtable; for I take his Books to be the <hi>dehoneſtamenta humani generis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I deſire them to regard the ſence of all Mankinde, in the words of <hi>Iſiodorus Peluſiota,</hi>

                     </gap>. This governed the Judicious and Learned Dr. <hi>Falkner;</hi> for when he had carried Chriſtian Loyalty as high as he could, to the honour of our Religion and the benefit of the world, for which we are all extreamly beholden to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50667:58"/> him, he concludes thus in his excellent Book, called <hi>Chriſtian Loyalty,</hi> (viz) <hi>That if any Prince undertakes to alienate his Kingdom, or to give it up into the hands of another Soveraign Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or that really acts the Deſtruction, or the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Calamity of his people;</hi> Grotius <hi>thinks that in his utmoſt extremity, the uſe of a Defence, as a laſt refuge,</hi> ultimo neceſſitatis preſidio, <hi>is not to be condemned, provided the care of the Common Good be preſerved.</hi> And <hi>if this be true,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it muſt be upon this ground, that ſuch attempts of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining do</hi> ipſo facto <hi>include a diſclaiming the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe perſons as Subjects, and conſequently of being their Prince or King.</hi> What unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs is there then in ſhutting the Door upon him, and making it faſt againſt him by an Act of State, who hath excluded himſelf by his principles and deſigns? For the truth of the fact, I ſhall onely refer you to his Secretary <hi>Coleman</hi> his Letters, wherein he ſaith, <hi>That his Maſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and the King of</hi> France <hi>his intereſt, is one and the ſame, and their deſign, their glorious deſign, the ſame,</hi> (viz) <hi>the extirpating the Northern He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</hi> How far the King of <hi>France</hi> hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with the deſign, the cruel Perſecution and Exiles of his Proteſtant Subjects (who at the time of that Letter were under the ſecurity and protection of the Laws of that Kingdom, and the Faith of that Crown) do declare to the world. And by what ſecret influences I know not, he is made ſo great, his Conqueſts ſo eaſie and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:50667:59"/> that he is like to do the work himſelf here in <hi>England</hi> too, and go away with all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But if the work muſt lie upon our hands, let no man think with himſelf that Popery is not to be introduced here, becauſe the numbers of Papiſts are few; for that will not render the deſign impracticable, but the execution of it more cruel and barbarous; a whole Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter muſt be corrupted from the Faith of the true Religion, or deſtroy'd. One ſingle arm of an ordinary ſtrength, not reſiſted, may aſſaſſinate a whole Nation.</p>
                  <p>Let no man betray his Country and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by pretending the example of the patience and ſufferance of the Primitive Chriſtians for our rule.</p>
                  <p>The Reformed Religion hath acquired a civil right, and the protection of Laws: if we ought not to loſe our Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates, but where forfeited by Law, we ought much rather not to loſe them for the profeſſion of the beſt Religion, which by Law is made the publick National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And it is ſtrange that ſome men of the ſame Religion in profeſſion, can think (that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding) it makes no matter what is done to men if they be Religious; but if they be not ſo, the leaſt publick injuries and injuſtice threatned or done them may be reſiſted, vindicated, remedied, and by right defended by old Laws, or new ones to be made for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian Religion was publiſh'd when
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50667:59"/> the whole world was Pagan, and therefore it was ſubmitted to ſuch uſage as the Governments would give it. But when the Chriſtian Faith had by miracles of patience declared it ſelf to be of Heaven, and of a divine Original; according to the Propheſies on that behalf, it took poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Empire; Crowns and Scepters became ſubmitted to the Croſs; The Chriſtians acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a civil right of Protection and Immunity, which they ought not, they cannot relinquiſh and abandon, no more than they can deſtroy themſelves, or ſuffer Violence and Cruelty to deſtroy the Innocent. Such as thus periſh, ſhall never wear a Martyrs Crown, but periſh in the next world for periſhing in this. This will be interpretatively Crucifying Chriſt afreſh after he is received up into Glory, <hi>i. e.</hi> after his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is exalted into Dignity, and Honour, and civil Authority. If the Senate of <hi>Rome</hi> had been Chriſtians, they would never have given up the Government to a Pagan <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> with a power to him and his Succeſſors to make Laws for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpating the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                  <p>What is ſaid of the Chriſtian Religion and Paganiſm, holds between the Reformed Religion and Popery.</p>
                  <p>If any man is ſo vain, as to ſay, that an unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courſe of Succeſſion to the Crown is eſtabliſhed amongſt us by Divine Right: I ſay, he is a man fitted to believe Tranſubſtantiation, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Pope; he is deeply lapſed into
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50667:60"/> Fanaticiſm, he dreams when he is awake, and his Dreams are Dreams of phrenſie. There are ſome things ſo falſe, that they cannot be diſproved, as ſome things are ſo evidently true, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved. This Propoſition hath no colour to ground it ſelf upon, no medium to prove it, no argument for it which is to be anſwered; nor is there any thing more abſurd than it ſelf, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to. But if any ſhall adde, that this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is the Doctrine of the Reformation, and adventure to tell the people ſo; they are the moſt impudent falſaries that ever any Age produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; when there is ſcarce a Child but hath heard what was done, ſaid, and maintained by the Clergie of <hi>England</hi> in the Caſe of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> in the earlieſt time of our Reformation here in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Age is bleſſed with a Clergie renownedly Learned and Prudent: By the Providence of God, and the Piety of our Anceſtors, they poſſeſs good, though not to be envyed, Revenues and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
                  <p>It is ſcarce poſſible they ſhould have many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that can countenance a propoſition ſo wickedly impious and ſacrilegious, <hi>That we cannot have new Laws for the preſervation of our Religion, but muſt loſe the old at the pleaſure of a Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> againſt not their own intereſt, and the Rights of the Church, but againſt the Rights and Liberty of Religion it ſelf. For ſhe is capable of Franchiſes and Immunities, which
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50667:60"/> ought above all things to be moſt zealouſly aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and defended by her Miniſters. Can they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their own hands ever pull down her Hedg and deſtroy her Defenſatives, and expoſe her helpleſs to the rage of her implacable Enemies, and ſuſpend all the Legal ſecurity ſhe hath for her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, upon the Life of our preſent King, whom God long preſerve? If Kings be admitted to have a power to make Laws, one Proclamation may eſtabliſh the Popiſh Religion amongſt us; which the Papal Bulls, ſo long as that See continues, will never be able to effect.</p>
                  <p>Next to Religion her ſelf, the Revenues of the Church challenge their faithful care, for they are at beſt but Uſu-fructuary Truſtees of her Endowments for the Succeſſion, which they will wretchedly betray to an Arbitrary Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, if they do not repreſs ſuch Opinions that pretend to change the Government into an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <hi>jure Divinity Monarchy,</hi> which will leave nothing <hi>jure divino</hi> but it ſelf and the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Kings for their ſo doing have the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Sir <hi>Robert Filmer,</hi> who affirms in his Treatiſe called the <hi>Power of Kings,</hi> Fol. 1. <hi>That the Laws, Ordinances, Letters Patents, Priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Grants of Princes, have no force but during their Life, if they be not ratified by the expreſs conſent, or at leaſt by the ſufferance of the Prince following, who had a knowledge thereof.</hi> This is but the neceſſary conſequence and reſult from the Doctrine of the abſolute power of a Prince:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50667:61"/> for in ſuch Government the Conceſſions of a Predeceſſor can no more oblige the Succeſſor, than he can Govern when he is dead; and the Succeſſor muſt be abſolute in his time, as the Predeceſſors were in theirs. But in vain is the Net ſpread in the ſight of any Bird; this deceit is of ſo groſs a thread, that it cannot paſs with the common people, much leſs upon our Clergy.</p>
                  <p>But I will not diſſemble what may be the true reaſon of the ſeduction of ſome young good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured Gentlemen of the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>It is thus they perſwade themſelves, that if theſe principles and opinions of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlimited Power of Kings</hi> had been received, the late Wars had been prevented: Not rightly conſidering, that if ſuch opinions had never been broached, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally rejected, that War could never have enſued; and we ſhould together with peace have enjoyed our ancient Government which our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors tranſmitted to us, without that miſerable <hi>inter-regnum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I would not be perverſely underſtood by any man, as if I went about to juſtify our late War: This is all I ſay, that every Government once eſtabliſhed will continue for ever, if all the parts of it would unalterably conſent to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, to which their natural Allegiance doth oblige them: And never any Prince endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to change the Government, but where part of the people were firſt willing, or content to have it ſo.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:50667:61"/>
                  <p>Thoſe falſe flatterers that go about to remove the boundaries of power, and change the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are the greateſt enemies to the quiet and happy Reigns of Kings, and the peace and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>And if they do adventure to call their fellow-Subjects by any opprobrious names of diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, becauſe they will not joyn with them in ſuch change, they are as abſurdly impious and inſolent, as any Prince or State would be, who ſhould challenge another, as free and abſolute as himſelf, for his Tributary and Vaſſal; and traduce him for a troubler of the World, becauſe he would not Compoſe the Quarrel, thus inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſought, with the ſurrender of his Crown and Dignity.</p>
                  <p>I deſire theſe Gentlemen to conſider, that the happineſs of a Nation is beſt ſupported with Truth and Juſtice: This new Doctrine is not true; and whoſoever entertains a belief of it, is not onely barely miſtaken, but will be led by the miſtake, into the moſt miſchievous, impious, and ſacrilegious injuſtice and treachery.</p>
                  <p>It is very agreeable to a good man, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a propoſition with an eaſie belief, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the leaſt ſeeming probability of a ſecurity againſt the miſeries of War, by all means to be avoided. But this Doctrine of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Kings, is moſt dangerous to the Peace of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, for it is pregnant with Wars: Beſides that it will give bad Princes, which ſometime
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50667:62"/> hereafter may be Born into the World, (for ſuch there have been now and then) power to make their Reigns worſe than War, and Plague and Famine to boot.</p>
                  <p>The Panick fear of a change of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that this Doctrine occaſioned, and the Diviſions it made among us, was the principal cauſe of the late War.</p>
                  <p>It is not without reaſon, that, together with theſe new principles, revived ſince the Diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, we have a perpetual din and noiſe of <hi>Forty one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then that fatal War began, which proceeded to the deſtruction of the Prince, and ruin of the Church and State: The remembrance of it is the principal matter, that ſtuffs our weekly Pamphlets; and it is brought into common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and grown ſo trival, that it is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned and heard without abhorrence and regret: And what Service this can be to His Majeſty, I do not underſtand; much better it were, that the memory of it were utterly extinct and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed for ever, except onely in the Anniverſary of that great Prince that ſo fell. Then, I ſay, and then onely, is it fit to be remembred, when we are on our Knees to God Almighty, and in his preſence affecting our ſelves with ſorrow and remorſe, deprecating the like Judgments, and bewailing the National Sins that occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thoſe: For notwithſtanding, the Glories of that Great Prince his unhappy death, and the

                  <p>How then can this tend to the peace of the Nation, or the Honor of the King? what ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction is it to have our almoſt-healed wounds, thus perpetually rub'd and kept green?</p>

                  <p>We are affrighted by the weekly Pamphlets, with the expectation of another Parliamentary War; and this is the true reaſon of the mention of the late War, that we may forgo our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for fear of another. So it is written in our publick Prints, which are publiſhed under permiſſion, as if Parliaments are deſigned to be rendered hateful, and to be feared as Plagues, Famines, or Inundations of the Sea.</p>
                  <p>But who is to begin, who deſigns this War, the Pamphleteers, or thoſe that ſet them on work, beſt know: We had never heard of any ſuch thing, if the Mercenary writers of the Popiſh Faction had not told us of it, as they do weekly: and hitherto we cannot find any Colour for this affrightful Lye; they are impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſo to talk of it as if they believed it, and have brought ſome as weak men, as they are falſe Knaves, to a belief of it: But to do them no wrong, thoſe may beſt know what is to come
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50667:63"/> to paſs, who have the power of contriving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning.</p>

                  <p>The vileſt Traitors cannot contrive a greater prejudice to the King and his Family, than by advancing ſuch a diſmal thing into credit and belief: for fears, though but upon imaginary and falſe grounds, produce real effects, as well as they are in themſelves really afflictive; and that almoſt equally, if of continuance, to the evils feared. Do theſe men ſpeak like true Loyaliſts, that are mentioning perpetually the Calamitous War in the time of our Kings Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and fright us with another now enſuing; after thoſe Univerſal, Solemn, and hearty Joys of the whole Nation for his Reſtauration, after ſo many Millions of Money moſt dutifully iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the affections of his people from time to time at His Majeſties Royal pleaſure, and nothing complain'd of, but that they have not opportunities of iſſuing ten times more, to the ſervice of His Majeſties Glory? Nay, they ſpeak of this enſuing War, as if the Royal Standard was already diſplayed, and the Rebels had made their Muſters; which muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect the Royal Family with the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>If there were twenty <hi>Trajans</hi> derived from one ſtock, that had Reigned in an uninterrupted Succeſſion, Two immediate Succeſſours, that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50667:64"/> ſhould have their Reigns ſucceſſively attended with civil Wars, were enough to efface their own, and the glories and merits of ſuch Anceſtors. But baſe Caitiffs, you can no more truly believe the laſt Parliaments deſigned upon his Majeſties Crown and Dignity, to make War, and change the Government, than you can believe that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Mothers Child of them, before they came up to the laſt Parliaments, ſet his Houſe on fire and burnt his Wife and Children.</p>
                  <p>But theſe impudent Forgeries againſt the Houſe of Commons, are contrived to make the people afraid of Parliaments: that this new model of Government in proceſs of time, when we have an enterpriſing Succeſſor, may take place, for the ſervice of the Popiſh Religion. For upon the ſtrength of Dr. <hi>B—s</hi> performance, who hath with great labour found out (which is hard for any man acquainted with our Engliſh Hiſtory to be ignorant of) that our Parliaments were not always ſuch as now conſtituted: This bleſſed change of our Government will never be atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. The Nation will never be perſwaded, by any thing that he hath found out in his diligent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch, that the Houſe of Commons is an <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Wen,</hi> an unnatural Accreſcency to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and fit to be cut off, if that which is offered in the Argument to conſideration be duly weighed. Neither can the moſt inſolent Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox of Sir <hi>Robert Filmers Patriarcha,</hi> contribute much to this purpoſe. But for that I have in my
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50667:64"/> Argument too forwardly deſpiſed it, conſidering that many have conceived a favourable opinion of it, that it may be able to deceive but a very few for the time to come; for the ſake of ſuch Gentlemen who have not choſen their ſide, are glad of the leaſt Colour or dream of a Shadow, a ſingle opinion of any body, it matters not whom, to relieve their modeſty in their notorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from Truth, Juſtice and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I ſhall here conſider his Hypotheſis, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially for that it was Re-printed, and is mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the <hi>Factors</hi> for the Popiſh Plot.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I will draw it out ſhortly, in all its ſtrength, and make it more argumentative than he hath left it, (for he hath left his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Readers to find out the Argument, and to make the Concluſion.) <hi>Adam,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was the Father of Mankind; that to him as Father, belonged an Abſolute dominion over all his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents; that all Men being ſo born, are born under ſubjection to ſuch an Authority: This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſo reſerved upon us by God, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our birth, and the manner of coming into the World, is to be ſubmitted to, in the perſon of the preſent King, who by becoming King, is for that reaſon veſted with this Abſolute Authority. This power, and the duty of our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to it, reſults from our being Born, and coming into the World, after the manner of men.</hi> This power of Kings is grounded (by him) meerly upon this natural reſultance, and not
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50667:65"/> from any poſitive and expreſs Revelation from God, for ſuch, neither we, nor he, yet ever heard of.</p>
                  <p>We will now then conſider, what there is of weight in this fictitious Reaſon of Government, in which the World is ſo lately illuminated by this Speculator; what force there is in it to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel all Models of Government that are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the World, to confound Kingdoms and Nations, and to give Warranty to the bringing upon us all the miſeries that are deſigned by the Papiſts for us; which we are to be prepared to ſuffer, with moſt conſcientiuos patience, from the comforts and ſupports of this inſolent and vain pretence.</p>
                  <p>I appeal to the Reader of him, whether in thus ſtating his Doctrine, I have not made it more Argumentative and concluding to his purpoſe than he left it: I will take this method of remonſtrating the futility of his <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By conſidering what a Father is, and what his Duty towards, and Power over his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; in which it will be found, that nothing of Empire belongs to him as Father; that no more belonged to <hi>Adam</hi> over his Children, than did to any of his Children over their own.</p>
                  <p>That the Authority of Parents over their Children, continues together with Soveraign power, and is not at all abated by it; and that it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50667:65"/> cannot be the ſame, becauſe it continues entire with it.</p>
                  <p>That there is no footſteps in the Records of the Old Teſtament, to verifie his <hi>Hypotheſis;</hi> that we could not have wanted ſome Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about it from God, (if true) it being a matter ſo neceſſary for us to know. That no claims were made, (that we know of) to any ſuch authority in the earlieſt times, when the Right was unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, and muſt have been beſt underſtood, and could not have been forgotten, as now it is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
                  <p>Beſides that it was never uſed. The firſt Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Recorded in the Bible, make every Child of the common Anceſtor alike independent and abſolute, and ſo it would for ever have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued: And to this day we ſhould have been in the ſtate of Nature, and not United in any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ſo no King yet in the world, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Paternal Authority. That his Inſtances of exerciſing Soveraign power by the Fathers of Families, are not concluding, and to his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>That admitting <hi>Adam</hi> had while he lived been Univerſal Monarch, (yet if there be no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon and Foundation of Monarchy in the World, but this of Sir <hi>Robert Filmer) A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> right Heir not being known, (and if he were, might perhaps be an Ideot or Lunatick, ſome Cobler or Botcher under a Stall, or mean Perſon unfit to govern) we can have no right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50667:66"/> King in the World: for certain it is, that there is nothing in the World ſo perſonal as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and the duties and Rights that do reſult from them: For they are neither aſſignable to, nor can be exerciſed or exacted by and between any perſons, but the Relatives themſelves: So that this power of Sir <hi>R. F.</hi> hath no foundation of reaſon in the nature of things, was in Fact ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exerciſed, and is now utterly fallen to the ground, and all Government with it. A more puzled, vain, ſenſleſs and unlearned Paradox, was never yet offer'd to the world, nor a thing more miſchievous ever received. For firſt, the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power of a Prince over his Subjects, is not at all connatural to the dutiful Care of a Father over his Children.</p>
                  <p>It was the good pleaſure of God that this part of the immenſe world ſhould be planted with men endowed with a Capacity to admire his Power, Wiſdom and Goodneſs, and therefore to render him praiſe and worſhip: He deſign'd that we ſhould be happy in our own enjoyments, and promote the happineſs of each other; which is not to be performed, but by a mind ſerene, beneficent, and loving. He provided that the diſſeminations of Love ſhould run parallel, and be under alike neceſſity with the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of our kind. For the planting Love in our Nature, he inſtituted Marriage for Procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we might owe our Being to the ſtate of the greateſt and moſt agreeable friendſhip,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50667:66"/> and tendereſt affection. That for many years we ſhould be educated by a pure, ſingle, and undeſigning love of our Parents: and the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of that conjugal State, ſhould be maintained by, and principally exerciſed in, their common care of their Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>Every Act of Love of either of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to the Child, being the beſt inſtance of love to the other of them; an endearment of a reciprocal love, and a provocation to the like love and care of the Child. And for this love the Children naturally pay a return of an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate honour to their Parents; and by that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour which we ſo naturally render our <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, our Earthly gods, we are initiated, trained up, and inſtructed devoutly to worſhip our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. God did likewiſe ordain, and ſo it was, that all Mankind ſhould derive from one ſtock, be made of one blood, and every Man every Mans Brother, of the ſame Family and cognation. By this it was provided by the Father of us all, that we ſhould be born into the World, under the tendereſt care for our preſervation, and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Nature; be powerfully enclined to love and beneficence; whereby we may be pleaſed with our ſelves, and at Peace and Amity with our whole kind; and diſpoſed to celebrate the infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs of our almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Creator, with moſt affectionate Praiſes.</p>
                  <p>That the Generations of Mankind might certainly proceed, God planted in our Natures
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:50667:67"/> powerful and irreſiſtible inſtincts to procrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the <hi>Jews</hi> call a Precept, tho after this no Precept ſeem'd neceſſary, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and multiply they make a Command. But we follow our own propenſions, and have no conſcience of obedience to a Law, when we obſerve and follow them; which are ſo ſtrong, pleaſurable, and entertaining, that if God had not planted a reſtraint of Modeſty in our Natures, and a ſenſe of decency, we ſhould over-do the buſineſs, and degrade our ſelves from the dignity of our Natures.</p>
                  <p>Thus far the Parents are fulfilling Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments, and gratifying their own Natures. What from all this can give them a right over their Child? All men coming into the world this way, are no leſs free, than if they had been form'd in <hi>Lucretius</hi> his Bottles, and drop't out of his imaginary matrixes, and we were all <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In this they are onely executing the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, are but his Inſtruments to bring us into this World, and are all along reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and entertained, and careſſed by the order of Nature. <hi>Adam</hi> ow'd this duty to God his Father; and ſo ordered it was, that he ow'd it to himſelf, and to his own natural propenſions, pleaſures and ſatisfactions to propagate.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral ſucceeding generations of men, as ſoon as they are men, have as much Right to the enjoyment of themſelves, to the freedom of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50667:67"/> their own Will, and to live by their own mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, as <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf had. Our Parents do not give us life, but hand it to us from the Fountain of being, the Univerſal Father of all things.</p>

                  <p>The Jews, who had a Kabala of the trueſt and moſt antient Theology and Morality, beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood their own Laws, and were furniſhed with the knowledg of what Power and Authority Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had over their Children, whether by nature, or by vertue of the fifth Commandment, did take their Sons to be <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> Emancipated and <hi>ſuoe poteſtatis,</hi> as ſoon as they were <hi>pubertatis plenoe:</hi> The time of which they reckoned, at the fartheſt, when they were 13 years, 3 months and one day old.

But three Months after, they reckoned him compleatly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult, upon a general Preſumption: when (and ſooner, if he were ſooner adult) he was free from the Power of his Father, and could not incur the mentioned Law, which condemns the rebellious and ſtubborn Son to be ſtoned to death. <hi>Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides Tract.

By which it doth appear, that the Jews did not take their Children to be longer under the authority of their Fathers, than until they commenced, in the ſooneſt account, Men. Beſides, that Law of <hi>Deut.</hi> Chap. 21. ſeems to be onely a permiſſion of an unnatural kind of ſeverity to the offended Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, at whoſe ſuit onely the puniſhment of that Law could be inflicted; ſuch a ſort of permiſſion and liberty it was, as was indulg'd to them in the matter of Divorce.</p>
                  <p>But that which hath impoſed upon this Gentleman, I believe, is, for that while they are to be educated, Parents exerciſe an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over their Children, which a ſower Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may imagine to be Power. This I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:50667:68"/> gave the Gentleman his miſtake, becauſe he ſaith a Child and a Slave doth not differ; which is a ſhrewd indication that he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too maſterly over his Children. But all equal parents know and underſtand, that the Education of their Children is duty and care; and it may, not improperly, be called a Sort of Generation-Work.</p>
                  <p>For I pray let it be conſidered, That the foetus is not perfected aſſoon as it is extruded the Matrix, no not until it be able to perform, unaſſiſted, all the Actions of its proper life. That the life of a man is a life of Reaſon. That he cannot do the Acts of a man until he hath it in the exerciſe of it. He is not a perfect foetus, ſo as to be neglected by his parents, as ſoon as he can feed himſelf: the man after this may miſcarry; and after this, if expoſed by his parents, and not continued under their care, be abortivated. Education is a kind of Incubation. Our faculties are to be formed and drawn out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to uſe, as well as our body to be organized, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be denominated men. While this is accompliſhing, the parents are but executing the natural inſtinct of propagating their like; until they have made them men, they are not begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their own likeneſs. They therefore with an eaſie propenſion, and a natural care, do apply themſelves to offer things to their obſervation, to furniſh their Memories, to try their judgments in little Eſſays, to render them diſcourſive, to draw out their faculties into uſe, until by little
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:50667:69"/> and little they arrive at diſcretion, and a power to form true judgments of what belongs to them; and to govern themſelves in ſuch Affairs and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes that are to employ them.</p>
                  <p>But while this is a doing, they are under a Government of love and care, by the Arts of Diſcipline to be trained up to perfection. Several freakiſhneſſes and caprices are to be cured, and the ſtrength and luxuriancies of ſeveral natural Appetites are to be abated and reſtrained; and they are to be held to attention and obſervation, and made patient of inſtruction: Correction is to be adminiſtred to theſe purpoſes, and by theſe meaſures: But this duty of Correction doth not participate any thing of the Nature of Civil Government. It hath nothing of the Nature of puniſhment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarity, or vindicative Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>It is not for the gratifying of the Parents diſpleaſure to ſecure him againſt wrong or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, to deter others, but to amend, improve, and better the Child, and always terminated to, and directed to that end; and by thoſe meaſures it is tenderly and affectionately admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred.</p>
                  <p>It will not be impertinent to obſerve, that our Common Law had no opinion of any Soveraign Authority in a Father. And alſo that the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. which declares petty Treaſons as well as high Treaſons, doth not declare the Sons kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Father to be Treaſon, tho Treaſon it is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:50667:69"/> for a Servant to kill his Maſter. In which we have the Authority of our Parliament, and of the conſtant opinion of our Judges. That the nature and relation of a Father and a Son, doth not favour any thing of Government, or of a ſervile or Political ſubjection; For that they have not made Parricide Treaſon, though it is the moſt unnatural and moſt deteſtable Crime, and a far greater ſin than that of killing a Maſter.</p>
                  <p>But further, to clear the true notion of a Fathers Authority, that it is duty and care, not Empire and abſolute will; Let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that God by his right of Creation hath an abſolute, plenary, and direct dominion over us; we are more his than we are our own, or than any thing can be ours. Yet when he was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, of his gracious condeſcention to our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, to quiet our fears of his power, and to invite our love, and aſſure our hope, he did declare himſelf our Father, thereby to aſſure us, that he would not rule us <hi>pro imperio,</hi> and according to his abſolute right he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us. That ſtile he himſelf delights to uſe, and gives us leave to call him our Father; by which we all underſtand, that he will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with us according to his Right of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute domination, no not in the terms of ſtrict Right and Political Juſtice: But that he will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our frame, pity our infirmity, correct us as his Children, but not puniſh us with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating Juſtice.</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:50667:70"/>
                  <p>Amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> antiently no man was admitted a Judge in Criminal Cauſes, but he that was a Father of Children; that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of a Judge, might be abated by the tenderneſs of a Father; that he who had Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of his own, might have the more pity to thoſe of others; ſo different is the Office of a Judge, from the natural duty and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Father. It is the greateſt violence that can be done to Nature, to compel a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſit in Judgment upon his Son. Next to that of obliging and compelling a man to execute himſelf, to make it the Fathers duty to pronounce a capital Sentence upon the Son, is the moſt unnatural thing in the World. The Father and the Son in this conſideration are <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctae perſonae;</hi> and when the Sin of the Father is viſited upon the Son, the Son is afflicted, but the Father is puniſhed; and when the Son hath the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> the Father is taken to be confeſſed <hi>in tormentis ſilii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for a further inſtance to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how incompetent the duty of a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is with the Nature of a Father, I will obſerve, that notwithſtanding a Law was given to <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Sons, to eſtabliſh Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures according to the Tradition of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as may be ſeen in Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> his Book <hi>de jure Gentium ſecundum Hebraeos;</hi> which Law by the way had been ſupervacaneous, if the Power of a Prince did belong to <hi>Adam</hi> in the right of his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50667:70"/> Paternity, and a Government had been provided for them by their Birth. Yet, I ſay, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, there was ſuch a Relaxation of Juſtice in the World before the Flood, becauſe it could be only adminiſtred by a Father, or ſuch who participated of the ſtock of love lodg'd in the common Father, from whom his Children did derive their tenderneſs one to another, as they themſelves ſprang from him. That the World was grown ſo wicked within two ages (as men then liv'd) from the Creation, that a Univerſal deluge was brought upon the World, by the juſt Judgment of God, for the outragious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable Wickedneſs that had ſpread it ſelf u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally over mankind, 8 perſons only except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The overflowing deluge of Wickedneſs, that caus'd the deluge of waters, can't be imputed to a more probable cauſe, than to the indulgence and impunity that the obſerved and underſtood near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Kindred, that all men ſtood then in to one another muſt naturally occaſion.</p>
                  <p>This is a ſad conſequence of that natural Love in Parents towards their Children, which was intended for the propagation and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mankind.

What Monſter hath this laſt Age produced! a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, a Father, ſeriouſly endeavouring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all Mankind to offer up their Children to <hi>Moloch</hi> the Saturn of the Eaſterlings, who was but the Devil of Tyranny, as the name im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports!</p>

                     </gap>, the true Origine and Fountain of Love and Amity, and the ſocial Virtues which render men humane, from whence
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50667:71"/> flows all the happineſs of Mankind, will by this Doctrine be corrupted and rendred unſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and ſelf-deſigning. For when a Father performs an Act of Generation, it ſeems now he deſigns to add a ſlave to his Retinue; and when a Child is born, there is another <hi>Item</hi> added to the Inventory of his Eſtate. If this Fountain be corrupted, there can be nothing ſincerely kind after it in Humane Nature. The <hi>Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> is out-done by this Gentleman, and hath not performed half ſo renownedly in the great Work of depraving Humane Nature, as our Patriarchal Knight will do, if his Admirers can bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vogue and eſteem.</p>
                  <p>For the Author of the <hi>Leviathan</hi> allowed ſomething good in Humane Nature, ſeveral equal propenſions, which he terms her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and ſometimes adventures to call the Laws of Nature: But he concludes they are not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, and they are only fools who govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by them.</p>
                  <p>But this Gentlemen will not allow Nature to be good in her firſt inſtitution and deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though in this I think they are near agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> made the Pourtraicture of Humane Nature in an agreeableneſs to his own evil Ingeny; and this Knight did ſet himſelf: when he made this his draught of a <hi>Father,</hi> he could have no other Original but himſelf, or the Idea of the moroſe and ſowr Dr. <hi>P. H.</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired friend; but by his Character he had at leaſt
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50667:72"/> misfigured his underſtanding, and made it his own Nature by liking it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2ly. No more of authority belong'd to <hi>Adam</hi> over his Children, than does to any of his Children over his; for that this Authority pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Nature, and Nature is alike in all men. The duty of their education, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over them that is competent to that purpoſe, is as much belonging to them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon them, as upon the Protoplaſt. The duty is ſo perſonal, conſiſting <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that it cannot be transferred, or permitted abſolutely to any other perſon by the Parents; nor can any man challenge a right to it, or diſcharge the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from it, or require the ſame affection, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and reverence that is due from a Child to his Father.</p>
                  <p>To expect relative duties without Relation, is moſt unnatural; it is as impoſſible as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous. We may as well love and hate, rejoyce and grieve, without the proper object and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements of thoſe paſſions. The fundamental Rule of all morality, is that of <hi>Epictetus,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (that is to ſay) by the State and Condition in which we ſtand, the relations and reſpects under which we are conſidered, our duties are determined, meaſured, and adjuſted: upon which ſee <hi>Simplicius</hi> his Excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, wherein many things are ſaid agreeable to our purpoſe. This moral Aphoriſm is as certain as any propoſition in <hi>Euclid,</hi> as the Doctrine of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50667:72"/> proportional Triangles, and received as ſuch by all the Maſters of Moral Philoſophy. There is no other foundation of our duty to God or Man, or towards our ſelves: This Rule, whatever it is, muſt declare it. Whatever is meaſured and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by this Rule, is commonly called, (which is comprehenſive of all that is honeſt, juſt, and fit) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The application of this Rule is called by St. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which when a man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, he is perfectly moral. A man may as well pay his debts by giving away his Money, be grateful to his benefactor by being benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to ſtrangers, as perform that duty he owes his Father, to any but he that is ſo: It is as impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſeparate the ſhadow from the Subſtance, as to make that ſubſiſt by it ſelf, which grows by reſultance from the ſtate and condition of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; or that without that ſtate of the perſon, from which it doth ariſe, it ſhould ever accrew.</p>
                  <p n="3">3ly. Admitting <hi>Adam</hi> had a Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over all his deſcendents, which muſt grow (if there was any ſuch thing) from ſome poſitive inſtitution, and not from his paternity, yet the natural Authority and Duty of Parents towards their Children, continues entire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Soveraign Power, and is not at all abated by it, and therefore cannot be the ſame. No Soveraign Power can extort the Children from their Fathers Authority and Care: This is a duty in Nature before Governments. They cannot belong to the Government, before they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50667:73"/> are <hi>filii praecepti,</hi> and capable of the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a Law. It is a duty in Parents to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducate their Children, and a right they have in conſequence to govern them, that cannot be taken from them. It is the Parents duty to form their Conſciences. They are appointed by God, the great Miniſters of his Providence and Grace to the Children. That they perform this Office, he hath tyed them to it by the ſweeteſt conſtraints and almoſt violences of Nature, by an irreſiſtable love and tyes of Endearment that cannot be broken. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares their Right of Authority over their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, againſt any interpoſings of Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to its prejudice, let or hinderance. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas</hi> poſitively determines, that it is not lawful for Chriſtian Kings to baptize the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt the will of their Parents, for that (ſaith he) it is againſt the courſe of natural juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4ly. Thereis no footſteps in the Records of the old world to verifie this Hypotheſis. That ſuch Authority was ſo much as pretended to, uſed or exerciſed by <hi>Adam;</hi> but we find inſtances againſt it in the ſhort Hiſtory before the Flood. <hi>Cain</hi> received no ſentence from <hi>Adam</hi> his Prince and Soveraign Judge, but from God himſelf, or rather from his <hi>Shecinah,</hi> or ſome viſible Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of his preſence.</p>
                  <p>Thence he obtained ſome degree of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and his life protected. No mention here
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50667:73"/> at all of <hi>Adam</hi> his taking the Tribunal, or <hi>Cains</hi> arraignment, or of any pardon or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence granted by King <hi>Adam. Lamech</hi> that had killed a man by miſchance, did not alledge his caſe at his Father <hi>Adams</hi> Court, and the matter of extenuation of the Man-killing; we hear of no pardon of Courſe to be allowed, when the circumſtances of fact had been firſt judicially conſidered.</p>
                  <p>How could a thing of ſuch importance be omitted in the ſtory of the old World, though ſo ſhort? It was of more concernment, than to know that <hi>Tubal Cain</hi> was the firſt Smith, and <hi>Jubal</hi> the firſt man that made a Muſical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to know the original nature and reaſon of Government.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, we find all the grand-Children of <hi>Noah</hi> becoming Princes of Countries, and the Sons and grand-Sons of <hi>Eſau</hi> alike Dukes and Princes; that is, at leaſt abſolute Fathers of their own Families, and ruling over ſuch as were their ſlaves and dependants.</p>
                  <p>And the 12 Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> are all called Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Nimrod</hi> plaid the Tyrant, we find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid for his juſtification, upon any Patriar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal right.</p>
                  <p>But if we conſult the Traditions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> they will inform us of another original of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that is this: They ſay that God gave ſeveral Precepts to <hi>Adam</hi> and his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50667:74"/> Sons, and <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons, and one amongſt the reſt, that they ſhould erect Governments, which his Sons could not have performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Rebellion againſt their King-Father, if <hi>Adam</hi> had been ſo, as Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi> firſt dreamt.</p>
                  <p>Alſo beſides that of making Governments, there was a Precept given them of honouring their Parents, <hi>Selden de jure Naturae ſecundum Hebraeos, fol.</hi> 792. And therefore the Precept of honouring Parents, is a diſtinct duty from that of obedience to Governments. By this Precept they had Authority in general to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh Governments amongſt themſelves, in the ſpecification of which, they were left to their own liberty and diſcretion, and therefore were not obliged to any ſingle form of Government. It muſt be underſtood, that the Precept which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> to eſtabliſh Governments, required alſo every mans Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to their Orders, Laws, and Decrees, when eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, We will conſider of the inſtances he gives of the Exerciſe of Soveraign Power by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of Families, which are as impertinent to his purpoſe, as his Doctrine is groundleſs and precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: But they are theſe: <hi>Abraham</hi>'s War, and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dahs</hi> Judgment upon <hi>Thamar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the firſt, of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s making War; We ſay we cannot allow that making War doth argue any Soveraign Authority: It is ſufficient, that he who makes it is under none
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50667:74"/> to make a vindicative War lawful. For an injured Perſon may, in the State of Nature, vindicate wrongs by an Authority derived from God and Nature to a juſt ſatisfaction: Becauſe there is no competent Judicature to appeal to for right and redreſs. But ſee how unhappy the Gentleman is! This very inſtance of his production, is clearly againſt him: For if Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power had been Patriarchal, <hi>Abraham</hi> had been guilty of Treaſon, in making War without a Commiſſion from <hi>Melchizedech</hi> the King of <hi>Salem,</hi> who, as the Learned men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, was <hi>Shem</hi> his Patriarch and Chief, and known by him for ſuch. But becauſe <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the beſt man perhaps in any Age, did not take a Commiſſion from <hi>Melchizedech</hi> his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trialchal chief, and yet he was bleſſed by <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedech</hi> when here turned from the War; We may conclude, that neither <hi>Melchizedech</hi> nor <hi>Abraham</hi> knew of any ſuch Patriarchal Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. And alſo from this great Example it appears, that it is lawful for him that is not a Soveraign, if he be not under any, to make War.</p>
                  <p>I will not enter into a diſcourſe, whence and how is derived the Authority of making War and capital Sentences, (for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt warrant both) which hath puzled ſome great Divines. Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that great man, was at a loſs in this enquiry, and thinks that nothing but a Divine Authority can warrant
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50667:75"/> them, which hath put them upon ſtrange extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Hypotheſes of Government, and ſent this Knights brains a Wool-gathering. But this may ſatisfie any man of ſence, That whatever is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the general happineſs of Mankind, and for preſerving peace in the World, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the innocent, and diſ-inabling the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty oppreſſors, is more commendable to be done, than the killing a man in his own defence is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply lawful.</p>
                  <p>As to his ſecond inſtance of <hi>Judah</hi> his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounced upon his Daughter-in-Law <hi>Thamar,</hi> which the Knight would have an exerciſe of Patriarchal Soveraign Authority; we ſay, how could <hi>Judah</hi> do this by a Patriarchal Power, when <hi>Jacob</hi> his Father was then alive, and for all that appears, <hi>Judah</hi> his Son was not extrafamiliated? Beſides, which is very unlucky, <hi>Thamar</hi> was then none of his Family, or of the Subjects of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick Empire; for his Son her Husband being dead, ſhe was free from the Law of her Husband, and ceaſed to be a Subject of his Paternal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> under the Authority of ſome Rabbins, which he cites in his excellent Book before mentioned, <hi>fol.</hi> 807. ſaith, That <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> might have the Office of a Prince or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in a diſtrict in that Country, and by that Authority might judg her according to the Laws of that Country. But what the Law was, and the Nature and Reaſon of her Offence, by which it became Capital, is not underſtood, as he tells us
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50667:75"/> in the place before-cited. I ſhall not trouble the Reader with unfolding the matter.</p>
                  <p>But why doth he trouble himſelf to make Kings <hi>Fathers of their Countries?</hi> Some cannot be ſo, and ſome have no mind to be ſo; and yet they ought to be Kings. And ſome that have not been Kings, have been ſo, and ſo ſtyled; as the great <hi>M. Tully,</hi> for defeating the <hi>Catiline</hi>-Conſpiracy, was by decree of the Senate called <hi>Pater Patriae.</hi> Thoſe are with reaſon truly called <hi>Patres Patriae,</hi> which either relieve their Country from miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſſures, which is the civil death of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and for this reaſon our King hath the honour of being called <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> and we hope that he will wear that honourable Title, upon a ſecond deliverance of us from a moſt deplorable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe ſuch are called <hi>Patres Patriae,</hi> who bring the Nation to an exalted ſtate of happineſs, ſo much beyond their old ſtate of things, that they ſeem to give the Nation a new civil Life, Being, and Birth.</p>
                  <p>For his etymological argument from the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Word, it is too putid to be inſiſted upon, though not more ridiculous than his <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for that the reduction of our duty to our King to the fifth Commandment, may ſeem to give ſome advantage to this Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, with Fathers who know no bounds of their power over their Children; It muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50667:76"/> that the Decalogue is not a compleat Rule of Morality. The Decalogue compriſed the Principal Laws of that Common-wealth which God their Law-giver by a moſt Solemn Act of his Legiſlation, did more awfully oblige them to obſerve.</p>
                  <p>God that time was their King; Rebellion was as Idolatry; and the ſin of Witchcraft, and the Defection of one of their Cities to Idolatry, was puniſhed as a revolt and Rebellion, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 15. He had provided for his Honour and Worſhip, and their Allegiance, in the firſt Table; and did deſign by the fifth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lay the Foundation of all poſitive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, by providing for a Reciprocation of kindneſſes, by enjoyning the gratitude and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting returns of Children to their Parents, and by putting Children under obligations to be taught and inſtructed by their Parents. But our duty to Governors is more duly referred to all the other Commandments, becauſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſecures the obſervation of thoſe Laws to us, by which we enjoy our ſelves and ours, freed from the Volations of Luſt, Appetite, Fraud and Violence.</p>
                  <p>We do not honour our King by relief in his fortune, which is commanded to be done by our Parents in the precept of honouring them; our ſubſidies and Aids are not to that purpoſe, but contributions to the charges of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they are the juſt price of our immunity and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50667:76"/> protection, from fraud and violence; for which cauſe pay we tribute.</p>
                  <p>But whatſoever he be, that hath more reſpect for this Knights Works than I have, may find him more gently treated by a very worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in a very candid and judicious Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Patriarcha non Monarcha.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is the meaning of theſe flattering Books? they cannot but be nauſeous to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who is a very wiſe Prince, and knows how ſenſleſs ſuch Books are: and beſides, they make the People afraid, and the Nation unquiet, from the apprehenſions they give, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be changed. Notwithſtanding the King hath given ſuch ſolemn aſſurance to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his late Declaration, That we ſhall have frequent Parliaments, and that he will govern by Law.</p>
                  <p>They would have had a better market for the Divinity they beſtow upon Princes, with <hi>Alexander</hi> after he had loſt his Vertue, and with thoſe vile Emperours whoſe Names are <hi>Regum opprobria,</hi> for ſuch the flatterers of ancient times Deifyed: thoſe who had ceas'd to be men they made Gods, and when they had left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about them that was tolerable, they mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified their power, which was already moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.</p>
                  <p>If the Kings hereafter would but read the Hiſtory of Kings, under that concluſion, that a wiſe obſerver of Humane Events made after
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50667:77"/> a long obſervation and experience, and would make Experiments of the truth of it in their own reading, Kings would be glorious, and the Nations they govern happy and full of peace. They would find therein ſo many effectual Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments to fear God and regard men, and govern them righteouſly. It is this:

Beſides, God hath made one thing againſt another: There is a divine <hi>Nemeſis</hi> interwoven in the nature of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:50667:77"/> things. And God will always govern the World.</p>
                  <q>

                  <p>The great Mogol at his Inauguration ſwears, That his People ſhall be at peace at home, and victorious abroad, afflicted neither with Plague nor Famine, but enjoy Health and Plenty all his days.</p>
                  <p>This ſeems extraordinary Pompous and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogant; but it means no more than this, that he will govern them ſo vertuouſly, that Gods Providence ſhall be always propitious to his People; and is no more in plain Engliſh, than what our Church offers up in her publick Prayers for the King, <hi>(viz.) That he may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern us in Wealth, Peace, and Godlineſs;</hi> that he may live long, and ſo govern us, ought to be every honeſt mans Prayers. But after all theſe vain Hypotheſes contrived for making Kings Abſolute, it will be more eaſie for Kings to make their Reigns unquiet, and turn their Kingdoms into Fields of blood.</p>
                  <p>But laſtly, to revive the ancient Zeal of the true Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> againſt Popery: To rectify the miſtakes of ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Clergy about the Diſſenters: And of our late Parliaments, and their proceedings in reference to them;</p>
                  <p>Let it be conſidered, how unreaſonable their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:50667:78"/> apprehenſions are of any danger to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> from the deſires of the Houſe of Commons, of ſome indulgence or toleration in favour of the Diſſenters at this time; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the Proteſtant Religion is ſo ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beſet: ſhe hath reaſon now ſure to take all ſuch for her Friends, that are heartily Enemies to Popery, though not ſo ſkilful as they ſhould be to ward off its aſſaults. Since the Papiſts preſume to call them Fanaticks, though exactly conformable to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that will not aſſiſt to bring on the Popiſh Plot by diſ-believing it; and put us in fear of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, by taking all the courſes imaginable to provoke and exaſperate them, and to increaſe their diſcontents (which they maliciouſly heighten, and by falſhood and forgeries miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent:) To graft thereupon a Pretence of a Proteſtant Plot, for a pretext to extirpate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtantiſm and introduce Popery, which they impudently pretend to be of a more firm Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the Government than the Reformed Religion.</p>
                  <p>I pray let it be conſidered, that that which is tolerated is put under diſgrace, even for that it is tolerated; and that which tolerates, even for that it tolerates, hath the governing Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and in ſo much as it indulgeth, it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to modeſty and reaſon; and if that indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſhould be abuſed, it may and will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. It was never intended by the Houſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50667:78"/> of Commons, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be altered or modelled to an agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to any form or ſect of the Separation, or preſcrib'd to by any of the Diſſenters; or that ſhe ſhould be made ſubject to any of their rules or opinions, or her Liturgy laid aſide for Directories, or, which is worſe, undervalued to the prophane way of extemporizing: For as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſed and exerciſed, it deſerves no milder a ſtile. That <hi>the Church ſhould always govern by her own Wiſdom in her own Province, and in thoſe things that appertain to her, can never be deny'd her.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No man hath reaſon to ſay, though he hath great cauſe to diſlike the Separation, and to have a bad opinion of the Diſſenters, that he had rather ſubmit to Popery, than to any form of the Separation, for he need do neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he pleaſeth. No man that thus expreſſeth himſelf, but will be ſuſpected to ſeek an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and pretence to become a Papiſt, and to make a defection from the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if theſe Gentlemen have ſuch a diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt Schiſm and Separation (which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is the worſt diſeaſe any Church can la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under, and at this time threatens the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as well of the Proteſtant Religion it ſelf, as it doth to the Profeſſors of all denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations) let this ſharpen their Zeal againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery (which by its unhallowed arts hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned and exaſperated our Schiſm,) and put
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50667:79"/> them upon the uſe of all means to reconcile, if poſſible, the Schiſm, (that the Papiſts have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made, and by all means endeavour to continue) and take away, if poſſible, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it for the time to come: And thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the Arts of the Prieſts and Jeſuits for ſupplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our Church.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is a most deplorable thing, that our Church ſhould be kept rent and divided, in danger of being lost, between Rituality and Scrupuloſity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the Scruples of the Nonconformiſts, which I always thought, and do ſtill think groundleſs, and unreaſonable, have often moved me into ſome paſſion againſt them; yet upon conſideration, I think this their Scrupuloſity may be of God, and that ſome men are by him fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to it. That he hath provided it, as a bar and obſtacle in the Natures and Complexions of ſome devout men againſt any Innovations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, that dangerous ones may not ſteal upon the Church, for the better maintaining the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and purity of the Chriſtian Religion and Worſhip. But in ſaying this, I have ſaid no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is apt to give them a conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but rather to humble them: For the beſt men are not govern'd by their Temper and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but correct them by their Reaſon, and determine themſelves by a clear and him Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>What affrightment, all this while, either to Church or State, from this weak and pityable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50667:79"/> Scrupuloſity? Where lyes the Treaſon or Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nay or ſo much as contumacy againſt our Eccleſiaſtical Governours, which is ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided to them?</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian Religion may be prejudiced by addition to, as well as ſubſtraction from her rule: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by her additions hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt evacuated the Chriſtian Faith.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there may be a fineneſs in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mode of Religious Worſhip in it ſelf very juſtifiable, which may be not congenial to men of a courſe make. The Worſhip of God will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways favour of the manners of the people; men of dull capacity can ſcarce admit of any Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies without danger of falling into ſuperſtition, or hardly eſcape being vext with endleſs and incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſcruples about them, until for eaſe of their minds they throw them off.</p>
                  <p>But the wiſdom of the beſt Law-makers hath conſidered in giving Laws, what the people would bear, and not what is beſt to be enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and many things have been tolerated by them which they did not approve, <hi>Ne majoribus malis detur occaſio, aut etiam ne vileſcant ſine mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus leges.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is nothing more expoſeth the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Government to contempt, than a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and an open neglect of its Injunctions. But where obedience to Laws is exacted under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere penalties, where it doth not greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the common good to have them obſerved,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50667:80"/> that Government is unequal, and uſeth its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority unjuſtifiably. <hi>Leges cupiunt, ut jure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſideration of the ſad effects the Schiſm in our Church hath occaſioned, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that it hath brought upon our Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Governours. That Religion it ſelf is thereby made the ſcorn of Atheiſts. That the Papiſts are thereby furniſhed with matter of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, reproach and ſcandal to the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That every Age ſince it begun hath heightned the malignity of the Schiſm. That it ſeems now to deſpiſe the Cure of the greateſt <hi>Caſſanders.</hi> Theſe conſiderations, I ſay, make it infinitely deſirable to have it utterly extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>There ſeems to be now left but one way of accommodating our Diviſions, and that is, that we do not hereafter make thoſe things wherein we differ matter and reaſon of Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>That the Children of the Light and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, be at length as wiſe in this matter as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is at unity with it ſelf, under more and greater differences than thoſe that have troubled the peace of our Church; which is ſufficiently known to all Learned men.</p>
                  <p>Had it not been happy, that this Schiſm had been prevented by the uſe of the power of the Church in Eccleſiaſtical diſpenſations? If no Law had been made touching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50667:80"/> that gave the firſt occaſion to the Schiſm, it had been in the Power of the Church to have prevented it. No good Biſhop but would have relaxed the Canons that enjoyned theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies (about whoſe lawfulneſs there hath been ſo much Zeal miſpent, and unwarrantable heat and contention raiſed) for the ſake of peace, and preſervation of the Unity of the Church, to men peaceable, and otherwiſe obedient to her injunctions. <hi>So dangerous it is to make Laws in matters of Religion, which takes the conduct of Religion in ſo much from the Guides of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The beginning of contention is like the breaking out of waters, ſaith the wiſe man; and they are aſſoon as begun, more eaſily end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Before the Contenders have exaſperated one another with mutual ſeverities and contumelies, which at every return increaſe, until both ſides loſe either their Vertue, or the Reputation of it.</p>
                  <p>Can any man imagine that any prejudice can accrew to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> if ſhe did enlarge her Communion by making the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it more eaſie? eſpecially if this may be done without annulling any of her inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the better inſtructed Chriſtians will always, and the Weak may in time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly obſerve. But till they can, they may be received and retained of her Communion, and not be rejected by her cenſures, though they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50667:81"/> do not ſubmit to all of them at preſent. Will it be any prejudice, that the Number of her Biſhops be increaſed, and that Suffragans be appointed or approved by the preſent Biſhops, <hi>in partem ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudinis,</hi> as was enacted by the Statute 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 14. Which Law was repealed by 1, 2 <hi>P. M.</hi> and revived by 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cap. 1. Theſe Suffragans were not intended to participate of their Honours or Revenues. Had it not been much more eligible to have diſpenced with invincible Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, rather than a Schiſm ſhould have been occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, which the longer it continues will be more incurable, and with greater difficulty accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, as it grows likewiſe more miſchievous? <hi>Is it fit that the peace ſhould be hazarded, or the Nation put with reaſon or without reaſon in fear of it: Or a Kingdom turned into a Shambles for a Ceremony, or a Ritual in our publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which if omitted would leave the exerciſe of it ſolemn and decent?</hi> For no man knows the obſtinacy of inveterate prejudices, founded perhaps in the very Complexions and Natures of the Diſſenters, hardned alſo in their way by obſerving how little effect Laws have had for reducing their Numbers, and alſo how unpra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable any Severity is in the preſent broken and diſtracted ſtate of the Nation. Why may not Standing at the <hi>Sacrament</hi> be tolerated, (though Kneeling is the devouteſt geſture, and to me moſt agreeable) when it is a poſture of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er enjoyned in the Primitive Church, in their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50667:81"/> ſolemn Meetings for Divine Worſhip, between the Feaſts of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſontide?</hi> Why may not the ſigning of the Croſs in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> for the ſake of Peace and Unity, be diſpenſed with where deſired, when the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is entire without it? Why may not our publick <hi>Liturgie</hi> be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and altered, though it may be defended as it is, and as it is, entertains the devotions of the beſt men, meerly for this reaſon, becauſe it is not liked in ſome parts of it by ſome men, yet truly devout? Beſides, it is the wiſh of ſome excellent perſons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that our publick Offices were more, and thoſe we have not ſo long; and that the Church had a greater Treaſury of Prayers, and by variety of Forms for the ſame Office, were enlarged in her ſpirit of Prayer, and her publick Devotions heightned. Why may not the <hi>Rubrick</hi> be altered as general ſcruples ſhall ariſe, by the Authority of the Church? this would not leſſen her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but advance the eſteem of her Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in the exerciſe of it, when ſhe uſeth it for edification.</p>
                  <p>It is much better ſure to give place to an innocent opinion, when entertained by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Numbers, though a miſtake, than to keep up contention and ſtrife. Peace in the Church is better than preciſe and nice Orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and Union is to be preferred before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Truth, which is of no more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to our Salvation, than one of <hi>Euclids</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50667:82"/> though to be ſure not ſo certain, and of leſs uſe.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs of the Church is not to make men great Clerks, to improve us to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Schools; but to build men up in the Faith and Love of God, by which they may be inſtructed to every good Work. Her aim is not to make men courtly in their behaviour in our Churches, but truly devout: and true devotion will never fail to make the Publick Worſhip ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, and advance it beyond a decent formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p>But I would not be miſtaken; it is not the Diſſenters I intend to befriend, but the Church of <hi>England:</hi> for as for them, I declare I have no liking to any thing they ſay or do; and am eſpecially diſſatisfied with their very bad man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. It is difficult to abſtain from an inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, but that I think it would be thrown away upon them, and that they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent incorrigible. This is not the ſeaſon for inſtructing their Wiſdoms; we muſt wait for the <hi>mollia tempora fandi.</hi> I thus conclude, ſince that excellent perſon the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> hath been treated by them with ſuch petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancies and rude inſults, for his Sermon of the miſchiefs of Separation. If a diſcourſe mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with almoſt irreſiſtable reaſon, candour, temper and Addreſs, be matter of exaſperation, and they turn again, and are more hardned in their obſtinacies, and become more confirmed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50667:82"/> in their ſeparating way, nothing but their own thoughts, and the conſideration in what a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate condition they have brought the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion by their Separation, will reclaim them.</p>
                  <p>But it is expected that Governments ſhould be wiſe, that they manage and controul the Follies and Weakneſſes of thoſe committed to their care, that they may do the leaſt miſchief to themſelves and others, and by prudent and practicable methods amend and reform them. The moſt froward, weiward, and ſtubborn Children give their Parents the moſt care, and opportunities of exerciſing the moſt tender love for them, though they can take no complacency in their awkerdneſs. The Church of <hi>England</hi> is concerned to retain all her Children in her Family, to ſhut out none by abdication; that their numbers be not few, and ſhe be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when ſhe ſpeaks with her Enemy in the Gate. Not to provoke any of them to wrath, leſt they forſake her, and turn againſt her when diſtreſſes ſhall come upon her. She hath reaſon at this time ſure to make her Diſcipline eaſie, and to learn of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be more comprehenſive. Their Doctrine of comprehenſion is ſo large, that it deſtroys the Religion to increaſe the number of Profeſſors: but I mean no more, than that poſitive and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable inſtitutions may give place to the peace, ſecurity, and preſervation of Religion it ſelf,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50667:83"/> to whoſe ſervice they were firſt fram'd and deſign'd.</p>
                  <p>It hath been heretofore, of old it hath been ſaid, <hi>Mores Leges in poteſtatem pertraxerunt ſuam. Plato</hi> formed an <hi>Idea</hi> to himſelf of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, without reſpect to the manners of men; but he writ another, which he calls, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that is to ſay, accommodated and fitted to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people, and ſuch as they would bear. <hi>Origen,</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> applies to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> the Anſwer of a famous Law-giver, who asked, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether thoſe Laws he had given to his Citizens were the beſt? the anſwer was, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>i. e.</hi> not ſimply the beſt, but the beſt they would bear. And we all know what God permitted to the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the matter of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, for the hardneſs of their Hearts. When all is ſaid, <hi>People must be governed as they can.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the mean time, it is pity any of our zeal and indignation ſhould be miſpent, when we have uſe for it all againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the ſource whence all our Diviſions ſpring. To which we owe the firſt Separations that were made in our Church; which appears by undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Records, publiſhed by Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> in his Book called the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonableneſs of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> How they have propagated, multiplied, exaſperated, and promoted our Diviſions, to tell you, would make a Volume; beſides, no Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant is now to know it. I have only this fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50667:83"/> to obſerve, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at firſt only deſigned by the Arts of dividing us, and breaking us into ſeveral Communions, to diſgrace the Reformation, to make our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Governours, Paſtors, and Teachers, loſe their Authority with the People: To deprave our Religion with licentious opiniaſtre, and abſurd dogmatizing; to load our departure from that Church, with the miſchief of innumerable Schiſms; and to make us reconcilable to the Tyranny and Impoſtures of that Church, from the vain opinions and licentiouſneſs of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries, who have been ſeduced, managed, infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and made wild by their impoſturous Arts and Deceits.</p>
                  <p>This, I believe, was only at firſt deſigned by the Prieſts, but now they apparently deſign by the Diſſenters to deſtroy the Church, or by the Church to deſtroy the Diſſenters, that they more eaſily come to rights with her. They imagine the Diſſenters are very numerous, and that the Nation is fallen into two great parts; that the Diſſenters numbers are vaſt. But God be thanked, they neither make our Grand Jury-men, nor the common Halls of the City of <hi>London,</hi> for chuſing the Lord-Mayors or Sheriffs. And I challenge any man to give me a Liſt of all the Names of Diſſenters that were of the Houſe of Commons in our two laſt Parliaments: I am ſure they will not make a Number: but they reckon the Numbers of Diſſenters, by the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50667:84"/> care they have taken to increaſe it. They uſed great art to continue the Separation when His Majeſty was reſtored: Since, Laws have been made to raiſe the Animoſities of Diſſenters, but ſcarce ever executed for repreſſing them. If for any reaſon of State the Laws here and there, and for a ſpurt, have been exacted, ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and ſupports have been given to their Preachers of greateſt Authority with them. And when they have ſeem'd to preach with the courage and zeal of Confeſſors to their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they have not only been aſſured of indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but have received rewards. How proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſly did the work of Separation go on by theſe Councils of our <hi>Achitophels!</hi> by theſe means they concluded it would be heightned, that it would admit of no terms of an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. How inſolent were their Harangues! more taking with their deluded Auditors, while they apprehended them acted with an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible zeal of Religion. What Animations did their People receive to defy the Church and her Authority, when their Preachers deſpiſed Fines and Impriſonment, to their ſeeming, out of pure zeal againſt her Order!</p>
                  <p>It is well known, ſeveral of them were in Penſion; and no men have been better received by the D. than <hi>J. J. J. O. E. B.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> &amp;c. Ringleaders of the Separation. Beſides that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſts have been taken and executed for preaching in Field-meetings in <hi>Scotland.</hi> They have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50667:84"/> raiſed there a ſort of <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi> more wild and miſchievous than any we had amongſt us in the times of licentiouſneſs. They have had, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, great Lords that have patronized them, who were always well received in their applications in their favour, at St. <hi>James</hi>'s; and ſeveral of their Preachers, who were not Prieſts, have received Exhibition and Penſions for their encouragement. It was neceſſary that the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm planted in <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſhould be very loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, to make that Nation abate any of their zeal for the Proteſtant Religion, or to neglect their fears and apprehenſions of Popery, or to make the leaſt ſtep towards it.</p>
                  <p>Awake, you drowſie Sleepers, open your eyes! the Sun is riſen, there is light enough to fill your ſight, if you would look up, and were willing to ſee. Could any thing be conceived more apt to bring the Church of <hi>England</hi> into contempt and ſcorn with thoſe of the Separation, than to have Laws made in her favour, penal Laws which are thought to be of her procurement, and not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted? Vain and ineffective anger is always returned with contumely, ſcorn, and hatred: <hi>Cupide conculcatur nimis ante metitum.</hi> And ſo it hath ſucceeded in this caſe; nothing hath been more paſſable than the baſeſt ſcurrility upon the Church, the Biſhops, and the Clergie. The Atheiſt, the impious and profane, have liſted themſelves Fanaticks, that they might have the greater Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of reviling Religion it ſelf with impunity.</p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:50667:85"/>
                  <p>Conſider how the Church of <hi>England</hi> is uſed, which is truly the Bulwark of the Proteſtant Religion. About ten years ſince, they deſigned to ſlight her works, and demoliſh her, by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Indulgence and Toleration: And now they intend to deſtroy her Garriſon, thoſe that can and will defend her againſt Popery. By one of their Pamphleteers, the Separation is called an Uſurpation upon the Government; and all the Diſſenters (as ſuch only) Rebels, and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous to the King. The ſame Gentleman would perſwade the world, that the ready way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate Popery, is by rooting out of Fanaticiſm; whether (ſaith he) the Fanaticks bring on the Jeſuits Plot, or the Jeſuits the Fanaticks, is not a farthing matter: But in the mean time, that the Papiſts have a Plot on foot, needs no proof. That any ſort of Proteſtants are engaged in a Plot, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved: But all honeſt Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> think it more righteous to puniſh the Deceivers, and pity the Deceived, and wiſh them only cut off that make Diviſions. It is one way of curing, or rather of extinguiſhing the Diſeaſe, to kill the Patient; but no Prince did ever yet provide Cut throats for his People, in epidemical Diſeaſes, inſtead of Phyſicians.</p>
                  <p>But if the Papiſts could arm other Proteſtants againſt Diſſenters, there would be the leſs work for Papiſts to do: And they will be ſure to requite them for this Favour with <hi>Polyphemus</hi> his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:50667:85"/>
                  <p>For, to give the Devil his due, they are not themſelves ſo fond of Maſſacres and deſtruction of Hereticks, as to envy that employment to any other that will undertake it. They had rather any other party of men ſhould do the drudgery for them. Beſides, what one ſort of Proteſtants ſhall execute upon another, will give them better pretence and more hardineſs (if they wanted either Pretence or Reſolution to deſtroy ſuch as they call Hereticks) to execute the like deſtruction upon the Church-Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, who certainly differ more from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, than the Separatiſts do from our Church. Surely there is good reaſon they ſhould be more ſharply treated by the Papiſts, than they treated the Diſſenters. And if they are in ſuch ſort uſed, they muſt lay their hands upon their mouths, and be ſilent before their Perſecutors, and acknowledge the righteous Judgment of God, in bringing ſuch tribulation upon them, from their Enemies, wherewith they troubled their own Brethren.</p>
                  <p>But there are better ways ſure of putting an end to the Popiſh Plot, than by putting it in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for them; That is to ſay,</p>
                  <p>By ſuppreſſing that contumacy that is grown ſo rife in the Diſſenters, againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by putting the revilers of her Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Order under the ſevereſt Penalties.</p>
                  <p>By the Church her condeſcention and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences to thoſe that are weak and ſcrupulous,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50667:86"/> and the peaceable Diſſenters, ſuch Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not abate, but magnifie her Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> will not be by this means loſt, but her Governance preſerv'd, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if the Relaxation that ſhall be made proceeds from her <hi>ex mero motu,</hi> and is not impoſed upon her by any ſecular Authority. Nay, ſhe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by this means more ample and venerable. What Glories will then ſhine upon the heads of the Biſhops! We ſhall all riſe up and call them bleſſed. They will attain an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> here, and receive divine Honours while they live. Their Order will be recovered into the higheſt Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it will never be after a queſtion in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, whether the Order of Biſhops be Apoſtolical.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament will make all Laws yield and comply to ſuch happy, peaceable, and gratious Intendments. All the people will honour them as their common Saviours, that ſhall thus ſnatch us from the very brink of Ruine, and render the deſigns of the implacable Enemies of the Church, ready to take effect to the deſtruction of our Religion and Nation, utterly defeated.</p>
                  <p>But what puniſhments can we think too ſevere upon any, that ſhall be guilty of ſuch inſolent Iniquity, as not to allow that Liberty to the Church, which they ſeek as a favour from her to themſelves; that will not let the Church eſcape their Cenſures, when ſhe graciouſly exempts
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50667:86"/> them from her Cenſures, and pities their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Follies? What Fines and Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Pillories and Scourgings, do they deſerve, that perſecute the Church with Revilings, when they themſelves are tolerated? Their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation muſt be juſt, whatever their doom be, themſelves being Judges. They will ſuffer as evil doers, and diſturbers of the peace, not for their Religion, but for a moſt extravagant and intolerable unrighteouſneſs. They who will not tolerate others, are themſelves for that reaſon moſt intolerable: Againſt theſe our Laws are to be ſharpned, and their iniquities to be puniſhed by a Judge. But the Statute of 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which puniſheth diſſatisfaction, and peaceable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawings from the publick Worſhip with Exile and Death, declares how odly the buſineſs of the Separation hath been managed, and with what diſadvantages to the Church; as it doth alſo the impracticableneſs of Laws, that make perhaps invincible prejudices, and modeſt and peaceable diſſatisfactions, capitally criminal. The execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Law is ſcarce poſſible. It is by no means agreeable, either to the Chriſtian temper of our Church, or his Majeſties great Clemency, of which he hath aſſured us in the general courſe of his Reign. And eſpecially for that, that Law hath been very rarely proceeded upon. A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that lay in <hi>Cambridge</hi>-Goal, under the Judgment of that Law, was reprieved by his Majeſty, with a great diſlike expreſſed by him
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50667:87"/> againſt that and ſuch like ſeverities. Whatever extravagances of a few wild Fanaticks of that Age occaſioned that Law, the ſtate of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and of the Nation being quite alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from what it was then, the execution of this Law now, would be ſomething like a She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs ſerving a Writ out of date in another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which can have no effect but miſchief to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>While our Diſſenters are thus reaſonably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, and ſtrictly obliged to their peaceable behaviour, they can give no apprehenſions to the Government, either in Church or State. This is all that is deſigned, and all that they ought to have. This certainly would be readily yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in this preſent juncture eſpecially, if the Evils of the late unhappy times did not ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their ſcore.</p>
                  <p>But I perſwade my ſelf, that as this courſe, if it had been heretofore taken, would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented one great cauſe of our late Troubles; ſo it will in ſuch meaſure prevent them from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, as the Separation can be accounted the cauſe of them.</p>
                  <p>As for the Sacriledge and Spoil which was then made upon our Church, it could never have hapned, but upon the diſſolution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor can it even happen again.</p>
                  <p>That War would have been impoſſible, if the Church-men had not maintained the Doctrine, that Monarchy was <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> in ſuch a ſence
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50667:87"/> that made the King abſolute; and they and the Church in conſequence periſhed by it.</p>
                  <p>But God be thanked, we ſee the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain reſtored to her endowments, grown wiſer than to deſire to hold that precariouſly, and at pleaſure, ſhe doth enjoy by an unmovable legal Right. Of the three Eſtates of this Kingdom (for to ſuſpect any ſuch thing of the King, would be unpardonable Blaſphemy) there can be no reaſonable ſuſpition: Though of the Houſe of Commons it is become now lawful to ſuſpect, and ſay any thing that is evil. But no man but the Villains that deſign by diſhonouring them to change the Government, hath reaſon to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch a thought. The Members of the Houſe of Commons in our lateſt Parliaments, were all, upon the matter, entirely conformable to the Church of <hi>England.</hi> They were perſons of the beſt Eſtates, Reputation, and Honour in their Countries: And they, or ſuch as they, are like to make our ſucceeding Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>I have leave to put them under the impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſevereſt Curſe, if ever they do ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly impair the Church of her Revenues. And I deſire it may be aſſiſted with the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and paſſionate deſires of all good Chriſtians, that ſo the Curſe I now pronounce may operate upon them who ſhall incur it. <hi>He that deſigns, contrives, or conſents to ſpoil the Church of any of her Endowments: May a ſecret Curſe waſte his Subſtance; Let his Children be Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds,</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:50667:88"/> and beg their bread in deſolate places.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I know it is meditated, and deſigned by many, and the beſt men, that uſe to be ſent to Parliaments, to redeem in part that infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Sacriledge that was committed in the times of <hi>H.</hi> 8. Then Rectories appropriate to Religious Houſes, which had by Appropriations the cure of the Pariſh, that ought after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Monaſteries to be preſented to, were veſted in the Crown; whereby not only the Church was robbed, but the People chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of their Tythes, which were theirs to give, though not to retain, their <hi>Proemium</hi> for the Prieſts Miniſtrations; which are now often moſt ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and ſometimes ſcandalouſly performed. As alſo to diſincumber her Revenue of the Charges and Impoſitions of Firſt-fruits and Tenths, which were impoſed and exacted by the Pope, upon his pretence of being the oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical Paſtor and High-Prieſt of the Chriſtian Church; and at that time likewiſe conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Crown, and are as unreaſonably conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, as any thing can be that hath a Law for a pretext.</p>
                  <p>But for this, a Compenſation may be given to the Crown; and ſome way will be found out for augmentation of Vicaridges and re-indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Churches that loſt all in that unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd Sacriledge, committed by the unſatiable Avarice of that haughty and luxurious Prince. Theſe deſigns employ the care of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50667:88"/> of our principal Gentlemen, to purge the ſin and diſhonour brought upon the Nation by that extraordinary King.</p>
                  <p>But if there were reaſon for any fear, that the Nation could again incur the guilt of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, What warranty can this give to any of the Clergy of our Church to ſlack or abate the Zeal that is due for the purity of her Doctrine, prudence of her Diſcipline, and her commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, decent, and intelligible Devotion? Are they worthy to be named of her, that are ready to diſſert her, out of fear of a remote poſſibility that ſhe may not always have ſuch Largeſſes to give as ſhe now beſtows upon her Sons? Will they prefer the gift to the Altar, and declare all their Godlineſs to be Gain? To ſuffer Popery for ſuch a conſideration to be induced upon her, is a far worſe and more deteſtable Sacriledge than that they pretend to fear. This is to make the <hi>Anathemata</hi> of the Temple to inſerve to the diſhonour of the <hi>Numen.</hi> To deſecrate the Altar for the ſake of the gift: And will by the juſt Judgment of God (I fear) bring the abomination of deſolation again into our holy places.</p>
                  <p>Let none of her Sons, for the obtaining a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or a capacity for a double Benefice, betray her by neglecting her intereſt, thinking with themſelves that ſhe will otherwiſe be ſupported; for this their doings is no leſs than the ſin of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> who took money to betray our Lord, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50667:89"/> that he would by a Miracle reſcue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the hands of thoſe to whom he ſold and betrayed him.</p>
                  <p>The honeſt of our Clergy will have little ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction when that day comes. When they ſhall be reduced to Prayers and Tears, if they are fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any thing that they may lawfully do to prevent that miſerable ſtate, their Tears will be as water ſpilt upon the ground; and their Prayers will never find acceptance with God, nor be returned into their own boſom.</p>

                  <p>But above all, thoſe fine men are not to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproved, who are preparing pretences for their Revolt to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. They tell us, that the Reformation is depraved, and Popery it ſelf is much amended ſince the Reformation; that it is not ſo groſly ſuperſtitious, (though her Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions are ſtill enough to ſtifle Religion) nor ſo fabulous in her Legends, (ſhe need make no new ones, ſince ſhe gives authority ſtill to the old) nor ſo impoſturous in her cheats (for her Prieſts have not been <hi>Hocus-pocuſſes</hi> of late, uſed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tricks of Legerdemain, and preſented their Puppet-plays of moving and ſqueaking Images) ſince the Reformation, as before.</p>
                  <p>But they may know, that the reaſon why we have not maintained the dignity of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50667:89"/> intire, is this; for that Popery hath not been utterly extirpated from amongſt us, though their frequent Treaſons, and their notorious ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions have deſerved it.</p>
                  <p>By its continuance amongſt us, and the reſorts of their Prieſts hither, it hath created and fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Diviſions amongſt us, and corrupted her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from their obedience to her guidance and inſtructions: But ſhe her ſelf is ſtill the ſame ſhe was, the Reformation of the Church is ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. She hath made good her departure from the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> her Adverſaries have not been able to convict her of any fault therein, and by an eaſie victory ſhe hath triumphed over all their oppoſitions and contradictions.</p>
                  <p>And though Popery appear not altogether ſo deformed, by her Prieſts artificial Dreſs, and the Repreſentations they make of her to ſeduce us, and entice us to come again under her Yoke; yet we know ſhe hath more eſtabliſhed her Tyranny by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and more corrupted her Morals by her modern Caſuiſts ſince the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and thereby hath rendred her ſelf more deteſtable, and for ever to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>But though it may be true, that the Popiſh world is beholden to the Reformation, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery it ſelf is thereby amended in ſome overt things, and reformed in thoſe Countries that have not reformed from her. For in the Light of the Reformation they have ſeen Light, and have been aſhamed of ſome of their works
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50667:90"/> of darkneſs, and do not bring into preſent uſe ſome of their moſt groſs Impoſtures, and ſome worſe than Pagan Superſtitions. Yet when this light is extinguiſh'd, it will be a moſt diſmal and eternal Night upon the Chriſtian world. If we return to her, our Ears will be bored, and we ſhall be irredeemably enſlaved.</p>
                  <p>The ſpirit of Popery, if it returns and poſſeſſeth us again, that hath been walking in the reformed Countries as in dry places, ſeeking reſt and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none, and finds us thus ſwept and garniſht, will bring with it ſeven Devils more wicked than it ſelf, and our laſt eſtate will be worſe than the firſt.</p>
                  <p>The Pride, Cruelty and Avarice, Domination and Luxury of their Prieſthood, will be aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon us, and the minds of the Laity more lowly depreſſed by Superſtition and Ignorance. The Goſpel of Cardinal <hi>Palavicini</hi> will be the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Chriſtian Religion, or it may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe; for who can tell what will be the Religion that that Church will offer in proceſs of time to the world under the Chriſtian-Name? When the Pope by his pretended infallibility may make the Chriſtian Religion what he pleaſe, by interpreting, adding, altering, or detracting with an uncontroulable Authority. For us therefore to become Papiſts, to return to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> acknowledge the Popes Infallibility, (there is no other way to become Papiſts) is virtually to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the Chriſtian Faith, to renounce our Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to our Lord Chriſt, to prefer the Bulls of a
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50667:90"/> profane Pope, to the holy Oracles of God, and the Revelation of Jeſus, God bleſſed for ever.</p>
                  <p>With this Religion therefore we can never make an accommodation; we may as well make a Covenant with Hell. This (as Dr. <hi>Jackſon,</hi> one of the glories of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in his Book called <hi>The Eternal Truth of Scriptures,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently admoniſheth us) admits no terms of parley for any poſſible reconcilement: whoſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words to this purpoſe, I ſhall here tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>

                  <p>Sir,</p>
                  <p>Now I have given you my Anſwer to your Reaſons, to diſſwade me from publiſhing the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the Biſhops; by repreſenting how few of the Clergy can with reaſon be thought guilty of Opinions ſo miſchievous to the Church and State, which you charge to have generally corrupted them; and how eaſily and with little conſideration they will be laid aſide by them.</p>
                  <p>I will make no other Apologie for the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, than that I have communicated theſe thoughts to no Man alive, either of the Church
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50667:91"/> of <hi>England,</hi> or any other denomination, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted any mans advice about it. That I can ſerve to deſign of no party of men herein, nor any particular deſign of my own: I wiſh they can be ſerviceable in the leaſt degree to publick good. I have had them by me a great while, and have conſidered them under the ſeveral va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of temper that our bodies are diſpoſed to, which induce different thoughts, and various apprehenſions in moſt things, under the ſeveral paſſions that the fluctuation of publick affairs have occaſioned; under the Ebbs and Flows of Hopes and Fears in reference to the ſtate of the Kingdom, for ſome length of time. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to have the ſame appearance, and to give me the ſame ſatisfaction in all their ſeveral poſtures, and the views that I could take of them. I aſſure my ſelf I was ſincere when I thought, and that they reſult meerly from my Judgment (ſuch as it is) uncorrupted. That I am not perverted or biaſſed by any ſecret paſſion or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of any ſort, which many times lurk and ſteal upon us, deceive us unawares, and undiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly abuſe us. Sir, the ſum of my Apologie is this; that I know my ſelf ſincere, of honeſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, moved by nothing but a hearty love and affection to our King, Religion, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: And for what any man ſhall think of me, I am not Solicitous.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> Have in the <hi>Poſtſcript</hi> offered Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the <hi>Lawfulneſs</hi> of an Act of <hi>Excluſion,</hi> which to all <hi>true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> muſt needs be deſirable, if it can be lawfully <hi>obtained.</hi> Yet for the farther <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of <hi>unthinking people,</hi> and Men of <hi>weak Minds,</hi> (who are never certain, (eſpecially in <hi>great Matters</hi>) where Men of <hi>Note</hi> are divided in their <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> but for that very Reaſon, where they have no <hi>direct Reaſon</hi> to guide them in forming their <hi>Judgment,</hi> remain <hi>ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> if not <hi>doubtful;</hi> and for that they <hi>doubt,</hi> they muſt therefore conclude the Matter, as to themſelves, at leaſt <hi>unlawful</hi>) I have <hi>Reprinted</hi> theſe <hi>Diſcourſes,</hi> (that were Printed near three years ſince, in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>True it is, the <hi>Moſt</hi> cannot conſider duly of a <hi>Matter,</hi> and determine upon it, by their own proper <hi>Reaſonings</hi> and <hi>Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings:</hi> and yet they have ſo much <hi>reaſon</hi> as to think, That where <hi>Doctors</hi> differ they have reſpectively their <hi>reaſons</hi> for their <hi>different opinions,</hi> though they themſelves do not apprehend them; and conſequently at leaſt <hi>doubt,</hi> and of what they <hi>doubt</hi> they conclude <hi>unlawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet even the <hi>Moſt</hi> may judge what <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>moment</hi> the <hi>reaſons</hi> and <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</hi> upon which each <hi>party</hi> ground their <hi>Concluſions</hi> are of, if they are truly, clearly, and nakedly propounded, reflected upon, and made fit for their <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Capacity:</hi> and they may thereby be brought to diſcharge their <hi>doubt,</hi> and determine with clear <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> in any matter ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed,

                  <head>The Great and Weighty CONSIDERATIONS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> CONSIDERED.</head>
                  <p>WHatever is the ſubject matter upon which we exerciſe our thoughts, or whereupon we make our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, doth not make the Conſiderations of ſlight and vain Men GREAT and WEIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY. A man of ſlender Endowments doth not commence to be Wiſe, as ſoon as matters of great Moment take up his Thoughts. But if he be of ſuch a make, as renders him capable of being in any degree wiſe, he is affected with an ingenuous Shame, finding the matters too hard for his Capacity, and above his reach: He is diſpleaſed and diſſatisfied with his own dark, indiſtinct, and confuſed Conceptions, in which he himſelf can receive no ſatisfaction: he ſuſpends, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines nothing, but that he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the matter, and reſorts with deference to thoſe who are wiſer than himſelf.</p>
                  <p>But there is a ſort of Arrogant Fools who trouble the World, make it difficult to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand plain Truth, confound the Notions of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50667:98"/> things, blend things of remote diſtances in their nature together, or put one thing for another that have no affinity to each other; puzzle and perplex the minds of the Weak.</p>
                  <p>Theſe deſerve the Indignation of the better ſort of Judgments, who cannot but be empaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned while they ſee a great part of mankind abuſed to their hurt. By the villanous practices of ſome, deſigned to the endurance of the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs; and by a ſort of ſilly Knaves attempted upon, for deceiving them into a permiſſion of all the pretended evils to come upon them; who preſumptuouſly uſe their little Wit to enſnare the Conſciences, to perplex the Minds of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by Objections puzzling to the weak, by ſuch Reaſonings, as none but fools could think of, and none but bold Knaves would offer to the World: Such I take to be every immodeſt man who will adventure, not from his Underſtanding, and therefore from his Will, and conſequently his Intereſt, to ſpeak things that have no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and are not induc'd by the Laws of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and Diſcourſe; that have a tendency to diſpoſe men to ſcruple of Conſcience, and make them doubtful and unactive againſt the evils of the greateſt ſize that are deſign'd againſt them, and to neglect or reſiſt the Counſels of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt themſelves, and fatally fall under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned evils, notwithſtanding they are provided of a juſt and allowable Remedy againſt them.</p>
                  <p>There are, and ever was, and ever will be, to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50667:98"/> the trouble of Mankind, a ſort of literate Fools (who will always obtain ſome reputation with the ſtupid admiring Vulgar) made by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to little Underſtanding, and who have loſt that little for want of uſing it; who by Books good of bad, it matters not much, become grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fools than they could have been, if left to ſimple Nature; who by imperfect remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and undue joyning of things more imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, make moſt perverſe Judgments in all things they are converſant about. And if it happen that by their Complexion they prove forward, and are opinionated of their falſe Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they obtrude upon the World their unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, monſtrous, and incoherent Conceptions. And if they chance to mix their Diſcourſes with paſſages of Holy Scriptures, and thereby entitled Religion to their Abſurdities, they more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully amuſe, diſtract, and abuſe the Conſciences of the common People, and perplex them with Scruples and Prejudices, and that ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the only means of their preſervation. And this calls upon, and urgeth the Charity of ſuch to whom God hath given a better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to appear and come forth for the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and rectifying the Judgments of the moſt deceivable part of Mankind, and with juſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny and ſcorn to beat down the aſſumings and preſumptions of ſuch Pretenders and Smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers in Letters; eſpecially in ſuch a Weighty Matter as this, when the poor people (if miſtaken)
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50667:99"/> muſt be miſtaken to their Ruine, and periſh by the Deceit, if deceived; which, I hope, is ſcarce poſſible for very many to be, by this frivolous Pretender and Offerer of Conſiderations, which none but he that deſerves our pity could think of; but for that he dares to offer them publickly to the World, and under the ſtile of <hi>[Great and Weighty Conſiderations,]</hi> he moſt juſtly deſerves our Indignation, a private Scorn, &amp; a publick Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For that purpoſe we will now produce him.</p>
                  <p>HE begins his Conſiderations with a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and Recommendation of himſelf, and would fain prove his Honeſtly; for he was with reaſon conſcious that this undertaking would render him more than probably ſuſpected: He proves, as well as any thing he undertakes, and as well as it can be proved, That he is an honeſt man. This he would have the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe there is ſuch a thing as ſincerity in the World; and for that there have been ſome men that have owned an afflictive Righteous Cauſe againſt ſelf-intereſt, and the diſpleaſure of a prevailing Faction: but we know the Cauſe that he Patronizes, is the moſt unrighteous Cauſe that ever any man of Front eſpouſed: but that ſhould not trouble us. But that which afflicts us, and is the heart-aking of all good men, is, That this Scribler with too much reaſon we know, preſumes that the Brave men (whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viles
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50667:99"/> for adhering to the only means of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of three Kingdoms) with the Groſs of the Nation, are deſigned to be ſubdued by a party of men whoſe ſtrength the King in his profound Knowledg and Wiſdom beſt knows how to Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate: but certainly this Addreſſer imagines ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great, whatever he pretends, and that he is well backed by force. Otherwiſe he could not adventure publickly to deſpiſe the Intereſt of a Houſe of Commons. If this Conſiderer and his Fellow-Conſpirators had not ſome ſecret reſerves of Strength, he would not adviſe the King as he doth, to Adhere to, and Govern with the Houſe of Lords and his Privy-Council, and to lop off the Houſe of Commons from the Government as an unprofitable Branch.</p>
                  <p>In the next Paragraph he tells us, The <hi>Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Principle and Maxim of the true reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in this Kingdom, is fully Epitomized in this excellent Precept, Give to every one his due.</hi> If there can be more nonſenſe ſpoken in ſo many words, It is this Patriot muſt do it; and you ſhall find him often performing what I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for him. And ſure, after ſuch demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Honeſty, and proof of his Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, you muſt take him for a <hi>True Patriot,</hi> and a fit Addreſſer of GREAT and WEIGHTY Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>In the next Paragraph he undertakes to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50667:100"/> and allow, chide and diſapprove our lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men; I believe he means of the Houſe of Commons, but we want his Name; it's fit he ſhould diſcover himſelf, before we can admit him to ſit Judge of the Actions of the moſt excellent Perſons of the late Houſe of Commons. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf he would bluſh, (however immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt he appears in his Addreſs) if he were drawn out and expoſed to publick view under ſuch a Character; we might ſpare him the Pillory, rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Eggs, and Turnep-tops, which is due to infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Libellers againſt Governours; for he is a man of ſuch faſhion (I believe) that he would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer too much of Shame and Confuſion of Face, (if he were but known well enough to be pointed at) after we have done with him.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth Paragraph, he allows it is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing to eſtabliſh the True Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but he would not have it eſtabliſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Quick-ſands: neither would we, becauſe it is impoſſible it ſhould be ſo eſtabliſhed; we would not have it depend upon looſe accidents, expos'd to Chance and Contingencies, and expect it ſhould be ſupported by rare events, and morally impoſſible: nor to be left at Six and Sevens, a chance that is not upon the Die, and hope that things ſhould out of their Courſe and Nature unite and combine together for its ſupport.</p>
                  <p>That which is Glorious is ſo, becauſe it is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in it ſelf, and difficult to be atchieved;
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:50667:100"/> and whatever is difficult, is to be obtained by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual and extraordinary means: to deny or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the uſe of them when lawful, is to deny us the end; and is ſo far in truth from allowing it to be Glorious, that he doth not allow it at all.</p>
                  <p>That it is made difficult to ſupport the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion, we owe to the Popiſh Conſpiracy; and the deſign of this man is to make it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: to that purpoſe he requires you to lay aſide Humane Policy, which is the ſame as true Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence (which is the onely Guide God hath given us, and the onely Oracle he hath left us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult in our Affairs, and is never repugnant (as he would have it) but always conformable to the Laws of God and Nature) leſt we ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a Remedy againſt the deſigned miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs to us and our Religion.</p>
                  <p>To this commendable ſort of Policy, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Bill will be made agreeable in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Diſcourſe. That we may admit the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Doctrins of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to abandon our Reaſon; and that we may more eaſily again fall unto her, we muſt (if we will be ruled by the Conſiderer) renounce our Prudence; and thoſe that will not, muſt endure his ſlanderous Reproaches, with which he goes on to revile the Promoters of the Bill of Excluſion, whom he calls <hi>Hypocrites, Factious Spirits of the Fanatical Leven; that they make a Cloak of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to palliate black Deſigns; fierce Zealots, acting
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50667:101"/> like the Rump-Parliament, Guilty of Antichriſtian attempts, repugnant to the Ordinance of God, and to the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom; a few tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Zealots, aſſuming to themſelves a Soveraign and deſpotical Power of Depoſing the D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>KE of YORK:</hi> and ſays, <hi>That they impudently affirm, That this hath been the Ancient Cuſtom of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to Depoſe Princes, and diſpoſe of Kingdoms; whereas the Crown hath been always Haereditary, and never depended upon the Suffrages of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since this bad man preſumes to ſay ſo many bad words falſely of the Excellent Members of the late Houſe of Commons, reproches their Zeal for the publick Safety, moſt Heroically exerted in the time of the greateſt Need, and moſt threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Dangers; calls their appearance for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed by Law, Hypocriſie: And the proſecuting the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Helliſh Plot, and the beſt means of preventing the Plot from taking effect, black De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Since, I ſay, his Immodeſty hath given him ſo much Licence, I wonder he had no more Scurrilities, eſpecially ſince he is ſo impertinent as to call the Bill of Excluſion, an Antichriſtian Attempt, Repugnant to the Ordinance of God, (though God never yet made any Law or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in that Caſe,) and the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom; though no Laws of Men are ſo Fundamental but they are alterable.</p>
                  <p>The Conſtitution of Government is indeed
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50667:101"/> unalterable by Law, but no Laws but are alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Government; for the Government was before Laws, and made and conſtituted moſt chiefly for the buſineſs of Legiſlation.</p>
                  <p>That the Houſe of Commons aſſumes a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power, he knows to be falſe; and knows too, that all the world knows he is therein a Falſary. What can be expected of Candour or Sincerity from a man of ſuch Effrontery? and to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Slander compleat, he joyns Deſpotical to Soveraign power, as if they were the ſame; an inſtance of his egregious Ignorance, except he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the King: and would ſignifie to him that he hath deſpotical power, becauſe he hath a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Power: and this commends him indeed for a true Patriot. A Deſpotical Power is ſuch as Maſters uſe over their Servants, that command what they will, becauſe they will. Soveraign Power is exerciſed for the good of thoſe that are governed; and the Commands that come from the Soveraign Power, are Laws that are deduc'd from publick Reaſon, as they are the publick Meaſures, and are always reaſonable, or pretend to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>No body ever affirmed, before this Addreſſer to the King, That it hath been the Ancient Cuſtom of Parliaments to diſpoſe of the Crown, or that it depended upon the Suffrages of the Subjects; which he falſly and maliciouſly adventures to ſay, to miſrepreſent the moſt Venerable late Houſe of Commons, whoſe Proceedings will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50667:102"/> themſelves in true Story to all ſucceeding Generations, and will, we all hope, be ſeconded and out-done by the next; if the good People can keep themſelves from being deceived by ſuch Artificial men as this Addreſſer is.</p>
                  <p>But this is ſaid, and truly, That a Parliament, which is King, Lords, and Commons, have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and particularly, a Parliament in the Reign of that moſt Excellent Princeſs Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> of Eternal Memory, (the wiſeſt and greateſt of the Princes that are Glorious for the Reforming the Chriſtian Religion) did declare a Power in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for Great and Weighty Reaſons of State, to alter the Succeſſion, otherwiſe than of courſe it is by Law appointed: and moſt reaſonable it is; for no Government can want a Power to preſerve it ſelf, and obtain its great end, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Community and Polity it ſelf; and no leſs Reaſons than theſe, require and urge the Uſe and Exerciſe of this Power in an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for Excluding the D. from Succeeding to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England.</hi> In order to theſe ends, the Power of a Parliament is unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd, and unlimited; which this Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Monger calls Scoffingly (Impiouſly and Prophanely towards God, and irreverently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Government) Omnipotency.</p>
                  <p>In the next Paragraph, he produceth his firſt Reaſon againſt the Excluding Bill. And by an execrable Argument, he adventures to prove,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50667:102"/> 
                     <hi>That the deſcent of the Crown is Sacred,</hi> viz. <hi>That an Attainder in Treaſon cannot debar the next Heir from ſucceeding in the Government.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Heir had died of that Attainder, the Argument had been ſpoiled. For cannot that Power that can inflict Capital Sentences, and that ought to do it againſt all in ſubjection that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur them, Baniſh inſtead of Kill? ſure he is no true Friend to his Royal Highneſs, whatever he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends; we will ſooner admit him a true Patriot, for that he makes the condition of his preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive Heir ſo hard, That he muſt either <hi>Die</hi> or <hi>Reign.</hi> A very judicious Advocate, and deſerves very well of his Client, who will remember him, ſure, when he comes into his Kingdom, for bringing him into ſuch danger.</p>
                  <p>I believe this conſidering Patriot ſhifted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in this Conſideration into <hi>France,</hi> where they have Princes of the Blood, againſt whom no Criminal Proceſs can be formed, nor no Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Blood is admitted, to the purpoſe that the moſt enormous Crimes may not ſeem faults in thoſe that participate of the blood of that haughty Tyranny. But the better to diſguiſe himſelf, he criminates the Parliament, calls the Houſe of Commons in deriſion Cunning Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, that would have a new Model of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he chargeth them with aſſuming a power to depoſe the King, and will conclude, becauſe he will, (and hopes the People will take his Word for it) for no other reaſon in the world,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50667:103"/> that we may as well Depoſe the King, as fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe a Preſumptive Heir, which he will call de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him: for this Ruffian-like man will not ſubmit to the common uſe of Words, and is at defiance with the common Senſe of Mankind; and will ſay it, That it is as lawful to Depoſe the Poſſeſſor of the Crown, as to make an Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament for preſerving the Life of the preſent King, by diſabling the next Succeſſor that brings it in danger: And likens the late Houſe of Commons, upon the ſcore of their Bill of Excluſion, to the Rump. Oh! for a Diſcoverer that would bring this man to Light and Shame, and thereby to Reaſon and Sobriety.</p>
                  <p>Upon this weak and ſlight colour of a Reaſon, ſee in the next Paragraph how he lays about him, with what vehemency and expoſtulation; and yet in his magiſterial Rant, the trifler could no ſooner name an extravagant Bill, but he thinks of a Box of Gilded Pills, which if he had been lately under cure by Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Doctrine of the train of Thoughts, they could not eſcape coming together. And yet this Thinking Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſer is not altogether ſo happy in dividing and oppoſing, as in compounding. For he affirms, that to go about to eſtabliſh the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by a Bill to Exclude the Popiſh Succeſſour, is inconſiſtent with the Government, and is to deſtroy the very Root and Life of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:50667:103"/>
                  <p>But, pray Sir, for the ſake of Reaſon tell us; Doth the Government it ſelf depend upon the perſon that Governs? or is the Government it ſelf changed by the alteration of the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? may not Governments, for kind the ſame, have different modes of Succeſſion? and are not the kinds of Succeſſion, more than the kinds and forms of Government? Can the Government be ſafe without a Power to exclude a Perſon inhabil in Nature to ſupport it, or of one Principled to deſtroy it? Can we imagine a Government which is of Humane Contrivance, to be without a Power to preſerve it ſelf; and an Authority, in Caſes that threaten its Ruine, to interpoſe with apt Remedies for its preſervation? That a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment made by men ſhould be left meerly to chance, and the contingency of Birth, whatever happens of inability in the Perſons that come under the general Rule and Limitation of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
                  <p>Doth the Exerciſe of this power turn the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from being Hereditary to Elective? is there no difference between the inconvenience of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſeveral Degrees of fitneſs in ſeveral perſons competently qualified, and the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon evident notoriety to exclude one that deſigns the ſubverting of it, and the deſtruction of thoſe that are to be governed and protected and hath incurr'd a ſeverer Doom? I well hope there are very few in this Nation ſo ill inſtructed, that doth not think it in the Power of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50667:104"/> to depoſe a Prince who really undertakes to alienate his Kingdom, or to give it up into the hands of another Soveraign Power: Or that really acts the Deſtruction or the Univerſal Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of his People.</p>
                  <p>The Learned and Judicious Mr. <hi>Falkner,</hi> than whom there is no perſon of this Age with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in greater eſteem; Who truly merits the high eſteem of all men for his excellent Candour and Learning: In his Book called <hi>Chriſtian Loyalty,</hi> cannot deny the right to be ſo upon thoſe caſes really happening, but is not willing to ſuppoſe ſuch Caſes can ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in Fact. He tells us, If any ſuch ſtrange Caſe as is propoſed, ſhould really happen in the World, it would have its great difficulties. <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> (he tells us) thinks that in this utmoſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the uſe of ſuch defence as a laſt refuge, <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo neceſſitatis proeſidio,</hi> is not to be condemned, provided the care of the common Good be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And if this be true, ſaith he, it muſt be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Ground, that ſuch attempts of ruining do <hi>ipſo facto</hi> include a diſclaiming the Governing theſe perſons as Subjects, and conſeqently of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Prince and King; and then, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his Propoſition (ſaith he) would remain True, <hi>viz. That it is not lawful upon any pretence whatſoever, to take Arms againſt the King.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All that Mr. <hi>Falkner</hi> offers in this matter, out of his commendable Care and Zeal to Peace and Government, is, to argue the Caſes in Fact im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:50667:104"/> and that ſuch ſuppoſitions may be the undue imputations of Factious perſons againſt their Soveraign: He thinks that Princes may have a Conſideration of the Account they muſt give in the other World of their Government here: That they have a regard to their Honour and Eſteem, and a Reſpect to their Safety; To the quiet and ſerenity of their own minds, and will avoid the <hi>Diroe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltrices,</hi> and the Tortures of mind that attend Cruelty, and the Actors of great miſchief, and by ſuch Conſiderations as theſe be contain'd in their Duty.</p>
                  <p>But do theſe Arguments of his, that ſhould reaſonably, and ordinarily do, ſecure us againſt the Oppreſſions of Potentates, give us in this juncture any Security? are theſe Conſiderations Diſſwaſives or Incitements to a Popiſh Prince to act our Fears, and give reality to the Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? To any under the Principles and Counſels that guide ſuch a Prince already entred upon the Deſign, and his party obnoxious, theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations would urge him to proceed, and make our Calamity certain: Theſe Arguments of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to ſuch a ſtate of things, is like a <hi>Proteſtatio contra factum;</hi> and like the Sophiſtical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Stoicks, who would undertake to prove a thing acknowledged and exiſtent and preſent to be impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>How wild then and tranſported muſt this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot ſeem, who will undertake to argue the Bill guilty of the higheſt Iniquity and Injuſtice, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:50667:105"/> the greateſt and Beſt part of the Nation adjure them to anſwer it at his Tribunal, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge us (for ſo his Expoſtulations and Enquiries of us doth import) with intentions to over-reach Providence; and that we deſpair of the juſtneſs of our Cauſe, or the goodneſs of God. And he tells us, That God doth not want our Wickedneſs to fulfil his Holy Will.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer: How far the Providence of God will aſſiſt us in this undertaking we know not, it is not new in the world for the moſt Righteous Cauſes to be unproſperous; we are only to do our Duty, and leave the Iſſue and Event thereof to his All-Wiſe Providence. But we know, and are moſt aſſured of the Juſtneſs of the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and we have a good hope in the goodneſs of God, that he will ſucceed it, for that herein we are doing nothing that is evil, but fulfilling his Holy and Good Will: I mean, not that we are certain to obtain what we deſire and purſue: But it is the will of God concerning us, (who hath left us in the hands of our own Counſel, and hath not told us, That he will ſave us by a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle) that we ſhould be Loyal to our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, zealouſly love that excellent Religion and that excellent Government that his Gracious Providence hath eſtabliſhed amongſt us by Law: And alſo that we deſire and endeavour by Law to diſable (in the underſtanding of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Nation) a profeſt Enemy both to our Religion and Government, from getting into the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:50667:105"/> Throne; that he be not by that advantage of Power, enabled to effect his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>But we are reſolved we that will not call that Deſign Evil, tho' it do not ſucceed; nor think that we are not doing the Holy Will of God, tho' we ſhould be unproſperous therein, and without ſucceſs. If there was an Oracle to Conſult, we would not know what the Succeſs ſhould be, leſt our Virtue ſhould loſe its Glory. No brave man, but would deſpiſe all Auguries, when he is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for his Country, and things more precious to him than his Life. <hi>Sortilegis egeant dubij.</hi> This falſe Patriot takes Sanctuary in his Revolt from publick Intereſt; and he thinks he is ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Shore with his Plank before a Wreck, and will fly the Danger before it approaches: but we will do our Duty, weather the Storm ſecure of the event: for the goodneſs of the Cauſe makes us hopeful, and we will Triumph in our Integrity tho' diſappointed. Of any other Will of God, ſave what is his Will for us to do, as Citizens, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, or Martyrs, we are not ſo ſollicitous to know.</p>
                  <p>The Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> when adviſed by his Friend <hi>Labienus</hi> to Conſult the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> as to the event of the War in which he was then engaged, Thus anſwered him,
<q>
                        <l>Quid Quaeri <hi>Labiene</hi> Jubes? an liber in armis</l>
                        <l>Occubuiſſe velim potius quam Regna videre?</l>
                        <l>An noceat vis ulla bono? fortunaque perdat</l>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:50667:106"/>
                        <l>Oppoſita virtute minus? Laudandaque velle</l>
                        <l>Sit ſatis? Et nunquam ſucceſſu creſcit Honeſtum?</l>
                        <l>Scimus &amp; haec nobis non altius inſeret <hi>Ammon.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do but right to my Country-men, to bear my publick Teſtimony, that their generous and godly Reſolutions are agreeable to this Noble <hi>Roman.</hi> But that done, I will calmly tell him, That we are in a Legal method, allowed by the Government, contending for its preſervation by the Bill of Excluſion; and that moſt certainly he can have no right againſt a Law (for ſuch it will be, when that Bill hath the Royal Aſſent) to any thing that he ſhall forfeit thereby: And whether ſuch a Law is not moſt righteous, let God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men Judge.</p>
                  <p>And here it will not be amiſs to admoniſh this Patriot, That no man hath a Right to any thing from God and Nature (to uſe his Words which he uſeth, but doth not underſtand of what Import and value they are in this place) for the Rights of Property are of poſitive and civil Appointment and Inſtitution. No man can have, or is entitled to any thing, but what, and as the Law allots it to him. They deſign what is Right, what Wrong, and what is Injury and Theft; and the Law of God, both in the Reaſon and Nature of man, as well as by expreſs Revelation, forbids it. <hi>Nec natura poteſt juſtum ſecernere iniquo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men make Governments, and God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to obey them; yea, God Commands
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:50667:106"/> us in our Nature, to form our ſelves into Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. For that Mankind cannot tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubſiſt without them. What is greatly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, and promotes the happineſs of men, therefore ſeems to be Commanded, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a poſitive and affirmative Law of God in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is declared. What is or would be greatly miſchievous to mankind, if generally permitted, is therefore underſtood by us prohibited. The Miſchief declares the thing forbidden, and is the indication of a Negative Precept, or prohibitory Law. The pleaſure and ſatisfaction of mind that men take in being beneficent and agreeable to, and deſerving well of their own kind: The remorſes, ſhame, fear and regret that men neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſuffer from the ſenſe of their own actions, when they are offenſive, unequal and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, are the Sanctions of the Laws of Nature, and are truly the Rewards and Puniſhments of God in Nature.</p>
                  <p>So that Anarchy, which is the moſt intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate of Mankind, a ſtate of War and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, unreaſonable Paſſion, and unbounded Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, ſeems to be the moſt forbidden thing by God in Nature.</p>
                  <p>But Government, becauſe it makes men equal and reaſonable, juſt and peaceable, kind and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficent, or finds them ſo, encourageth them to be ſo, and protects them in being ſo; ſeems to be the moſt principal Inſtitution and Appointment of God in Nature, for that it is recommended to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:50667:107"/> us by all that which conduces to our happineſs. And thus, and for this reaſon, are Kings and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours ſaid to have their Authority from God, and therefore Government is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. Gods Ordinance. But the forms of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, the Perſons of the Governours, the Order of Succeſſion, their reſpective Powers and Miniſtries, are of Mans appointment: and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hereunto, Government is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or a Humane Creature, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.13, 24. to which the Apoſtle enjoyns us to be Obedient for the Lords ſake, and in Conſcience of our Duty to God.</p>
                  <p>Agreeable hereto is that Noble Tradition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> of the ſeven Precepts given by God to the Sons of <hi>Noah,</hi> that is, to all Mankind, for from him we all ſecondarily derive, in which the great Titles of the Law of Nature are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and to which all the Nations of the World were obliged: one of which is <hi>De Judiciis.</hi> The words of the Precept, which is the Seventh, are no more, ſignifying that the Law of Nature, or the Will of God in Nature, doth command us to live in Politys and under Governments. This Law was given or declared to all Mankind, when they were in a State of Nature, before Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were conſtituted; and by that Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, obliged to form themſelves into Societies, to enter into mutual Obligations, to ſtand to and abide the common meaſures of Law, and to aſſiſt and ſubmit to the Sentences and Decrees of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:50667:107"/> Judicatures. Theſe were the firſt Oaths of Allegiance that were taken in the world: but when a ſingle perſon was entruſted with the executive power of Laws, they ſwore this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to him. For in all regular Governments (as it is in this of ours) the King commands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but according to the Preſcript and Formu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la's of Law: And the whole buſineſs of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as between thoſe that are to be Governed, is making Laws, and executing them in a due Adminiſtration of Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>As Corollaries to what is ſaid, I ſhall add, firſt, That Mercenary Guards are very unnatural to Governments, as they ſeem, upon the foregoing Reaſons, to be inſtituted and appointed by God in Nature, which receive conformation from the Tradition and Doctrine of the <hi>Jews</hi> (the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed Nation in the world in the Mind of God) for that the whole body and power of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or Polity are bound to ſee the Law, and Reſults of their common Judicatures obey'd, and are amply ſufficient for that purpoſe. So that the head of the Polity, by the <hi>poſſe populi,</hi> being moſt powerfully inſtructed to execute the Laws, Mercenary Guards ſeem intended and deſigned, by thoſe that imploy them, to execute matters illegal and extrajudicial; or at beſt they make a very hard caſe upon the people, that they muſt ſupport a great charge, and pay a great price for jealouſies and fears.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That by the natural obligation of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:50667:108"/> the ancient Oath of Allegiance, every Member of the Polity is bound to reſiſt and ſubdue all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudicial Forces, riotous and routous Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.</p>
                  <p>But the nature of Government, and its true original, hath been prejudiced by an unhappy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake that hath long ſince invaded the World; men that underſtand nothing but Words; and Grammar-Divines, that without contemplating Gods Attributes, or the nature of man, or the reaſonableneſs of moral Precepts, have underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to declare the ſenſe of Scriptures; and infer that the Soveraign Power is not of Humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but of Divine Appointment; becauſe they find it there written, that <hi>by him Kings Reign;</hi> imagining that when the Scripture ſaith, God commands, or doth this, that God commanded it by expreſs Words, or doth it by an immediate poſition of the thing done. Whereas in Nature his Commands are nothing but the natural Light God hath beſtowed upon Mankind: Likewiſe God's doing a thing is only the courſe of natural and ſecond Cauſes, to which, becauſe God gives the Direction or Motion, he doth both, and is ſaid to do all that is done.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, all the Precepts that God gives us that are agreeable to the Law of Nature, muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood as Nature and Reaſon doth direct. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur Lex Dei idem dictans quod natura, ita accipi quomodo ipſa natura accipiendum monſtrat, niſi ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur aliquid Expreſſius;</hi> Grotius <hi>Comment. fol.</hi>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:50667:108"/> 121. The Laws of God, that confirm the Laws of men, innovate nothing but a new obligation to obſerve them (but only) as commanded and intended by thoſe that made them. All humane Conſtitutions and Governments muſt be ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient and obſequious to their own intentions. <hi>Omnes res conditoe famulantur vitoe humanoe:</hi> Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Form of Government is of our creation and not Gods, and muſt comply with the ſafety of the People in all that it can, without its own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: and was never intended unalterable, or at leaſt inflexible, but was intended and made under reſervations, reaſonable exceptions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen accidents, and rare contingencies in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Affairs. And the Law of God, that comes in confirmation and eſtabliſhment of humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and Laws, binds only according to their natures and intendments.</p>
                  <p>How unreaſonable therefore are the Tragical Exaggerations of the conſiderer, making it the moſt heinous wickedneſs, and the moſt crying Injuſtice, to alter that which in its own nature is alterable, and by an Act of the Government to exclude the D. from the Succeſſion, as a perſon unfit and unſafe to be entruſted with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! (though in the general order thereof, he was thereto deſigned) beſides that he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited that kind of right that he had by that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral appointment.</p>
                  <p>Is this, ſaith he, the way of eſtabliſhing the Proteſtant Religion? he ſaith, this is exactly to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:50667:109"/> follow the footſteps of that Monſter of Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the wicked <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who after God of his infinite goodneſs had raiſed him from nothing, and eſtabliſhed him Monarch of the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet was he ſo miſtruſtful of Gods Power in preſerving his Kingdom for the future, that he thought nothing could ſecure it but his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Policy.</p>
                  <p>Our Conſiderer ſeems to have a high value for Rule and Domination, otherwiſe he would not have called the advancement of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to rule by Uſurpation, an effect of the infinite goodneſs of God. But theſe words were put in, to make that ſtory of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> parallel to our caſe: and he intends thereby to remember us of the little power that the reformed Religion ſometimes had, perhaps in the time of Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and to charge upon the Proteſtant Religion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it with a Revolt and unjuſtifiable Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical departure from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the acquiring and poſſeſſing it ſelf of the Government: And now, behold the man! now you know him and his Religion, and how fit he is to offer Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the D. againſt the Bill.</p>
                  <p>But ſhortly, to deſtroy his parallel, he may know, that the Reformation did only aſſert and reaſſume the Rights of the Crown uſurp'd by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> We did reform the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Church to primitive Chriſtianity, from which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had ſeduced us; but
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:50667:109"/> therein we uſed no other Power than what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to every Church to reform it ſelf: we were never of right and duty ſubject to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe never rightfully had any Authority over us, and therefore we could not Schiſmatically revolt from her; nor are parallel at all in this to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> though this man will compare us to him, and thereby ſlily charge us with monſtrous Ingratitude to God, and accurſed Policies; becauſe we will not again give up our Civil Rights to the Tyranny of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor loſe again the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion in the Superſtitions and corrupt Doctrines of that Church; and becauſe we will not forbear to uſe that power which is lawful to every Government.</p>
                  <p>Except this be his meaning, and he himſelf a Papiſt, he might with as much pertinency have told any other ſtory of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> or of any other of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> in the Books of the <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Chronicles;</hi> or of <hi>Belte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> or <hi>Nebuchadonozor, Zenacherib, Ahaſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi> or <hi>Holofernes,</hi> or <hi>Antiochus,</hi> or any other King or Name in ſtory Sacred or Prophane. Of all theſe he could not have found out any thing more unlike to have compared with us, to have remarked himſelf for a man of great Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For <hi>Jeroboam</hi> corrupted the true Worſhip of God to ſupport an Uſurped Crown; but the deſign of the Bill againſt which he declaims, is to ſupport a Lawful Government, and the beſt Religion by a legal Act of that Government.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:50667:110"/>
                  <p>So that we will invert that Wo which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth againſt us out of the Prophet; <hi>Wo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that buildeth his houſe by unrighteouſneſs, and his chambers by wrong,</hi> into a Wo againſt himſelf <hi>Wo unto him that putteth evil for good, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for light, and caſteth a ſtumbling-block before his neighbour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in what follows of this Writer of Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, I doubt me whether he doth not act the part of a ſcorning Atheiſt; for that he would perſwade the World from all care and regard of Religion, by telling us, it is able to ſhift for it ſelf, it being the work of Gods own hand. His Atheiſtical ſcorn and low valuation of the true Chriſtian Religion, is further very notorious and remarkable, for that he makes the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof amongſt us to be ſuch a like work of the Almighty Hand of God, that eſtabliſh'd <hi>Jeroboam</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> O thou <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſatus Galata!</hi> to return thy own Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which thou uſeſt againſt thy own honeſt and diſcerning Country-men, upon thy ſtupid ſelf: For who, I pray you, but a ſenſeleſs man, would compare a providential permiſſion of the revolt of the ten Tribes for the ſins of <hi>David,</hi> and the ſins and oppreſſions of <hi>Solomon</hi> (to which the People were prepared by the exactions, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and riotous Reign of <hi>Solomon</hi> and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Rehoboam</hi>) to the work of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was the delivery and reſtoring to it ſelf the Goſpel of Chriſt, and his true Religion,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:50667:110"/> (which was ſpoiled and depraved by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) for the benefit I doubt not of all the Ages of Mankind to the end of the World; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail; and which we in deſpight of the <hi>Roman</hi> Succeſſor ſhall ſee yet flouriſh in this Land.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt not expect, though God did firſt plant his Church by Miracles in Nature, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the Spirit of Power, by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and by the Spirit of Glory reſting upon the Primitive Martyrs of the Holy Faith, and did reſtore the purity of the Chriſtian Faith by a Miraculous Providence and the Spirit of Martyrdom, which we are now peacefully and Legally poſſeſſed of; I ſay, we have no reaſon to expect Wonders for our preſervation, when it ſeems to be in our own hands: Nor ought we to ſubject the Profeſſors of the True Religion again to Slaughters, Fire and Faggot, Tortures, Inquiſitions and Maſſacres.</p>
                  <p>Let us not think that our Government, as it lies in Hiſtory, and our Laws in Books and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Rolls (which will eaſily ſuffer an <hi>Index expurgatorius,</hi> and make no complaint,) can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us and it againſt the Inſtruments and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines deſigned for its ſubverſion in the Plot, and the powers that have been long addreſſing to that purpoſe, and are now at leiſure to execute what we know is deſigned againſt us, better than we can make out and diſcover. This Expreſſion, I know, would ſcarce paſs for ſenſe in any other
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:50667:111"/> Age or Matter, but we live in an Age of Myſtery and Prodigy, producing things Monſtrous and unnatural, and our Language muſt be agreeable to the things we ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>The True Patriot proceeds and affirms, That it is an unwarrantable Attempt, and a point with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out example or preſident, to Depoſe a Prince for not complying with his People in Religion. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all that ſhall read him, whether he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a man of Reading enough to warrant him to pronounce a general Negative in this matter? But by this time there is nothing ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant but you will allow agreeable to the man. I believe immodeſty is the unhappy Vice and Fate of his Nature, for no man ever arrived to the like Degree in it before him: you muſt not ask what he means by a point without example or preſident, or why he puts us a point that is not in our Caſe, and ſtill will be talking of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a Prince; for this man oweth no account of his matters. But, thou Falſe Conſiderer; So Loyal I am, That I would not have that point in the Caſe for half I am worth.</p>
                  <p>But pray why thus impertinent? Why doſt thou ſend us to <hi>Aſa</hi> and <hi>Maachah, Jeroboam, Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam, Jehu</hi> and <hi>Joram, Aſa</hi> and his Mother, and <hi>Azaria?</hi> we know little of the Conſtitution of the Jewiſh Monarchy, ſave that God after the Jews had rejected his Government, and deſired a King, kept ſome remains of his Theocracy over them, which he adminiſtred by his Prophets,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:50667:111"/> whom he commiſſioned to Exauctorate and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint Kings. Their Hiſtories are ſhort; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, every Nation is to be governed by their own Laws, and there are as many kinds almoſt of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments as there are Governments; we are not warranted by their Preſidents, nor to be Juſtified or Condemned by them; but we muſt Stand or Fall to our own Laws. But let this Patriot know, that our caſe will never be <hi>Cromwels,</hi> (as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches us,) &amp; we will not, neither can we ſtand in need of any Apology that would ſerve either for the <hi>Rump</hi> or him; for we are preſerving that Government and Church which they deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Neither will we, O man of ſmall Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, make uſe in our defence of the Papiſts exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the King of <hi>Navarr,</hi> a Proteſtant King in <hi>France:</hi> No more than we will allow the <hi>French</hi> to murder a Proteſtant Miniſter, becauſe we exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute a Seditious Traiterous <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt: No more than we can allow in others, or juſtifie in our ſelves to proſecute diſſenting Proteſtants, whoſe Principles are peaceable and obedient to Governours: Becauſe we duly ſharpen our Laws, and exact the Severity of them againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, the ſworn enemy to all Religions but their own, and to all mankind upon the ſcore there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. How groſly therefore is that of the Apoſtle miſapplyed, <hi>Whoſoever thou art O man that judgeſt another,</hi> &amp;c. For doth a publick Executioner incur the Judgment of ſhedding mans Blood, for
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:50667:112"/> executing a Sentence againſt a Murderer. Thou man of Obſervation mayſt poſſibly know what kind of Beaſts we muzzle and tye up.</p>
                  <p>He obſerves for our Imitation, That the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox did not Depoſe the <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperours: we ought undoubtedly to imitate them therein: for that no man, much leſs a Prince, ought to loſe any right for a Speculative Error, or meer miſ-belief: But onely for wicked practices and opinions that promote, excite and encourage them. But it is alſo very obſervable, which the Conſiderer, by his mention of <hi>Julian</hi> the Emperour in this place, gives me occaſion to offer: That the Behaviour of the Church towards the Pagan <hi>Roman</hi> Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, was much different from that which they bore to <hi>Julian,</hi> who ſucceeded to Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, was educated a Chriſtian, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bore a place in the Church: for whereas the Apoſtles had enjoyned the Chriſtians to pray for the Pagan Emperours, though actual Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Church; yet the whole Church did Curſe and Anathematize <hi>Julian</hi> with an Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, <hi>quo Deus rogatur ut aliquem è medio tollat. In Julianum cum defectioni adderet machinationes evertendi Chriſtianiſmi, uſa eſt Eccleſia iſto extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae neceſſitatis telo, &amp; à Deo eſt exaudita.</hi> Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius in Luc. Cap. 6. Verſ. 12. I will not trouble the Reader with more Quotations to this purpoſe; the Authority of this Great man is more than ten Witneſſes. And for what he lays down ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that the Orthodox did not Depoſe the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:50667:112"/> 
                     <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperours: I muſt remember him out of <hi>Socrates</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorian, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 38. Gr. when the Souldiers of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> Emperour were by his command ſent to enforce them to become <hi>Arrians,</hi> they took Arms in defence of their profeſſion of Religion; how juſtifiable therein, I will not now diſcourſe. But this may be ſaid, that the Chriſtian Religion with indifferency to all Sects, was made the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Empire by Imperial Reſcripts, and all Chriſtians had thereby a Civil Right to a free and undiſturbed profeſſion of their Religion in their ſeveral Perſwaſions: For <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great carried ſo indifferent an hand between the Contending Parties, that he endeavoured to make Peace rather by ſilencing the Diſputes, than by determining the Controverſie: Worthy of the imitation of the Guides of Chriſtendom; and the onely means of freeing the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from being depraved by the Jargon and Gibberiſh of the Sectaries.</p>
                  <p>If the Crown ſhould devolve upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Succeſſor, it would require conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we could juſtifie the Dethroning of him; though the <hi>French</hi> Papiſt could not be juſtified in rejecting the King of <hi>Navar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this untrue Patriot ſhifts his Cauſe from what it is, to what it is not, that he may have ſome colour to inveigh againſt the true Patriots, far more excellent and righteous than himſelf; and have ſome umbrage to betray the beſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:50667:113"/> and the beſt Government, while he pretends with falſe Hypocriſie to ſupport them.</p>
                  <p>But I am glad to find in him at leaſt one grain of Senſe and Honeſty; he ſaith well (to do him right) that is the beſt Religion that gives every one his due. But he muſt conſider farther, to the confuſion of the Cauſe he Advocates, That to give every one his due, is to adminiſter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Innocent, and by Authority of Law to ſubdue the aggreſſors of Mankind, how great and mighty ſoever they be; for they that are mighty Offenders, ought in proportion to be mightily puniſhed: <hi>Fiat Juſtitia</hi> therefore, as he ſaith, <hi>Ruat Coelum:</hi> for, to puniſh, much leſs to lay a reſtraint upon evil Perſons, is <hi>not to do evil that good may come of it;</hi> which he would impute to the proceedings in Parliament againſt the Duke, for which he muſt be ſelf-condemned, for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take him for a <hi>German</hi> Anabaptiſt.</p>
                  <p>And now we find this Conſiderer complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Pamphleteers, that write ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sophiſtical, and unreaſonable Reaſons; that tell ſtories (he ſaith) of <hi>Edgar Athelin, Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am the Conquerour, Arthur Plantagenet,</hi> and King <hi>John;</hi> that write Antichriſtian and Fanatical Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, never heard of, until the Spirit of <hi>Belial</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it to <hi>Oliver</hi> and the <hi>Rump.</hi> I believe, if there be any ſuch Pamphlet, this Pamphleteer is the Author of it, or ſome of his Complices: to the purpoſe that there might ſeem ſome one worſe than his own; and that he might be able
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:50667:113"/> to quarrel with, and confute, and do advantage to his bad Cauſe by ſome worſe Reaſonings than he would ſeem to be Maſter of, or than his Cauſe is capable of, which is not capable of a good one.</p>
                  <p>But what he ſays cannot poſſibly be true of any Pamphlet; but rather than he will not be ſlandering, he will ſlander himſelf, and belie the Devil: For obſerve, he ſaith, they uſe Fanatical Logick, and Antichriſtian Logick. The true Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, being impatient of the reſtraints of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and to be confined to ſober ſenſe, call Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and Reaſoning by that which they would ſeem moſt to hate, Antichriſtian. The true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtians and Papiſts, being impatient of the light reproof and diſcovery of Reaſon, call ſound Reaſon Fanaticiſm. But our Writer is ſo ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geancely angry with reaſoning, that with the ſame breath he calls Logick, for the ſake of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Antichriſtian and Fanatical too; and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders himſelf ſuſpected of being an Antichriſtian Fanatick.</p>
                  <p>And yet any one may ſee, that it is not the thing it ſelf that he is thus angry with, but the name of Logick that he thus expoſeth; for what it is he knows not, he ſeems to think it comes by Inſpiration, and that there are two ſorts of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick; one good, but he is not acquainted (for all that appears to us) with the Spirit from whence that is derived; and another bad, which, he ſays, is inſpired by the Spirit of <hi>Belial;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:50667:114"/> moſt certainly there is no ſuch Devil amongſt all the Orders of the Apoſtate Angels: Sons of <hi>Belial</hi> I have heard of indeed, that did evil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out profit, without deſign, for evils ſake; but theſe are ſuch men as need no Tempter; for they will be wicked without a Tempter, according to the fatal propenſions of their vitious Natures, and are not to be managed by the Devil himſelf: And to this ſort of men doth our Pamphleteer ſeem ſomewhat to approach, for that he is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable Tranſgreſſor.</p>
                  <p>No reaſon can be given of him, why he ſhould with ſo much ſeeming earneſtneſs concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to perſwade the People to abandon to an utter neglect thoſe things that of all others are of moſt value to them, their Religion, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Lives, Liberties and Eſtates. To perſwade a whole Nation to lay violent hands upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to cut their own Throats, to burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alive and their Houſes; and to deſtroy themſelves, their Wives and Children, Bodies and Souls too, for Conſcience-ſake. That there can be a Subject not ſubject to Laws; and that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences that cannot be rated, becauſe their miſchiefs are infinite, for that very reaſon muſt not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and he would have us reckon it a ſin of the moſt heinous nature, to puniſh the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with a diminution only in his power to do thoſe evils which are moſt notoriouſly by him deſigned, and will be effected by means of his own making and cauſing, if he himſelf ſhould
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:50667:114"/> relent and refuſe to execute them. If in this Age of Licenſe, immodeſty could entitle any man to be a ſon of <hi>Belial,</hi> our Writer of Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might fairly pretend to it, who is immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt for impudence ſake, which ſpends it ſelf in waſte, and cannot effect any thing but the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it ſelf. In ſaying this, I ſhould think my ſelf very ſevere, but that he hath publiſhed his own ſhame; and if I would, it is not in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to cover it.</p>
                  <p>But he hath not ſhewed the worſt of himſelf yet, he attempts further upon the Underſtanding of the People; he will have us believe that we owe Allegiance to the Preſumptive Heir; that we have as many Kings as Princes of the Bloud; and that a Son hath a right to his Fathers Eſtate before he is dead: For the probable Succeſſor can have no more right to the effect of the Oath of Allegiance, than the eldeſt Son to receive the Profits of his Fathers Eſtate without his leave in his Fathers Life-time.</p>
                  <p>If this Gentleman's Father had had any Land, he would have underſtood the difference between his right to the Land after his Father's Death, and his hopes and poſſibility onely to have it du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Father's Life. The word Heir is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Succeſſor in the Oath of Allegiance, to ſignifie, that it means Heirs in the proper ſence, which is ſuch that ſucceed to the Inheritance; and not ſuch as are in expectancy or poſſibility of having the Inheritance, who are improperly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:50667:115"/> and equivocally ſo called. And tho' the thing is ſo plain, that every man as well as the Lawyers agree what is ſaid; yet my Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> for ſaying the ſame, is called by this Gentleman, Silly and Ridiculous, Fallacious and Impertinent.</p>
                  <p>The Lawyers tell me, that it is a Rule in the Law, <hi>Non eſt hoeres viventis;</hi> that is, No man can have an Heir while he lives; and they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſay of all the <hi>Reguloe Juris,</hi> There is not one of greater extent and rule than this; that it hath governed Ten thouſand Caſes near upon in the Common Law; and they withal aſſure me, that notwithſtanding this man (amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther civil terms) calls the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> Fallacious, they firmly believe, if a Fee had been offered to him of the value of his Eſtate, which is about 200000 <hi>l.</hi> he would not have ſigned an Opinion with a <hi>Videtur</hi> to the contrary; but he is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that all Mankind ſhall be miſtaken, and he will call their reaſonings in this matter what he pleaſeth; New <hi>Machiavillian</hi> Logick, a word that diſhoneſtly he took up, on purpoſe to expoſe the Bill to the Vulgar, imagining in his profound Conſideration, that ſome of the Multitude will, upon the hearing of <hi>Machiavillian,</hi> fall thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into an unwitting diſlike of the Bill.</p>
                  <p>Nay, he will conclude an Heir Apparent to be an Heir, becauſe he could not be Heir Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent unleſs he were an Heir; when the word Apparent and the word Preſumptive more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:50667:115"/> joyned to Heir, is a term of Abatement or Negative, and diſtinguiſheth him from being a real Heir, and ſpeaks him no Heir, but onely one in a near poſſibility of being ſo. But, ſays he, it is a manifeſt contradiction for one to be Heir Apparent, and not to be Heir; as it is to be a Learned man and no man. <hi>Prius eſt eſſe, quam eſſe tale.</hi> I wiſh we had his Name, that we may mark the moſt abſurd reaſonings by it, for the everlaſting Honour of this Pretender to Reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Diſcourſe. We all know that the word Heir is a Name to deſign a Perſon under ſuch a relation and reſpect, and imports nothing of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; and we may uſe our own abſtract Terms properly or improperly, and without any corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent reality, to an equivocal ſenſe.</p>
                  <p>But he adds Profaneneſs to his Levity, and as if the Holy Scriptures were writ to ſo trifling a deſign, as to be an Oracular Dictionary, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Nomenclature; he tells us how the word Heir is uſed in Scripture, when the holy Writers formed their Language by the vulgar Idiomes amongſt the People of the Jews, and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to write Law-Caſes, much leſs to declare the Common Law of <hi>England,</hi> or imagined that their ſtile ſhould be produced to expound our Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy.</p>
                  <p>But now, thou vain Conſiderer, wilt thou hence conclude, that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> is Heir and Succeſſor? That we now owe him Faith and Allegiance? That he is already in the Throne,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:50667:116"/> and that this Bill, though it pretends onely to forecloſe him, doth truly depoſe him?</p>
                  <p>It is inſufferable, that this man ſhould impute to the Houſe of Commons, and the beſt People of <hi>England, Diabolical Fiction, the worſt of all Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical Equivocations, and of endeavouring to make a colour to their perfidious and perjurious dealings,</hi> for theſe reaſons onely, becauſe we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, or take our ſelves to have ſworn Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> when we ſwore it to the King: Becauſe we will not allow that a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>England,</hi> which is the King, Lords, and Commons, have no more to do with our Government than the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> or that the Pope hath as much power to depoſe one of the Kings, as the Parliament hath to puniſh a moſt obnoxious Subject: This he dares addreſs to the King, and publiſh to the World.</p>
                  <p>He proceeds to preſume and tell us, that this at leaſt muſt be granted, that whoſoever is by Bloud next Heir to the Crown, we are by our Oath obliged before God to bear him Faith and true Allegiance: nay, to defend him againſt all attempts, until he is diſinherited by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and therefore, ſays he, whatſoever we do againſt him, before this Act be fully eſtabliſhed, is a violation of our Oath, and therefore the very attempt of voting and paſſing this Bill, makes the actors and abettors Perjurers before God and the World.</p>
                  <p>Sure it will be allowed, that this Gentleman is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:50667:116"/> miſtaken; ſure he doth not intend to ſpeak Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but hath a way of ſpeaking which he will uſe by himſelf, and will make Words ſtand for what he hath a mind to: which Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his, this peremptory abſolute man thinks himſelf not bound to explain, though to ſave his Neck, if he ſhould be Indicted therefore of Treaſon, which I deſire he may, and Arraigned too, for the better clearing the matter, if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, how we are now bound to bear Faith and true Allegiance to the Duke: But he will ſooner be Hanged, than make out how a thing may be done Lawfully, which is not Lawful to go about: That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> may be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Diſ-inherited, but the Voting and Paſſing of the Bill muſt be Perjury. May not he that is bound by an Oath to pay money, deſire a releaſe from the Debt without Perjury? Cannot all Civil Debts, Duties and Contracts, though confirmed by Oath, be diſcharged by the Intereſted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to whom the Duty is to be performed, and for whoſe Benefit the Contract is made? May not Kings, by renouncing their Governments, make the Oath of Allegiance ceaſe to all effects of Obligation? And cannot an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that ſhall diſable a Succeſſour, equally prevent it from paſſing any Obligation upon us?</p>
                  <p>But ſhortly to explain of what Import, and for what reaſon the words Heirs and Succeſſors are put into the Oath of Allegiance: and it is this,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:50667:117"/> That in caſe of the Demiſe of the King, and the Devolving and veſting of the Crown upon the Heir and Succeſſor, the Oath that we took to the Predeceſſor, by virtue of thoſe Words laies hold upon our Conſciences, and obligeth us to him from the firſt minute of his Reign, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and ſo we are not one minute free from the Bonds of our Allegiance. This being the ſcope of the Law that requires it, and of the Oath it ſelf, it muſt likewiſe be by that interpreted; for <hi>finis diſcendi eſt ratio dictorum,</hi> and an Oath doth not oblige as this or that man would interpret, neither according to the vulgar or technical uſe of the Word, but in ſuch a ſenſe as is adaequate and agreeable to the Intent and End of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and requiring it.</p>
                  <p>But by what is ſaid before, it appears that we are not yet under the Obligation of that Oath to the Duke, and that it is in the Pleaſure and Power of the Parliament, whether we ever ſhall be; our Comfort is (whatever he thinks) that there is a great difference between Hopes and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And further, it appears that the Heir Apparent is but equivocally, and in a leſs proper ſenſe ſo; and yet this Conſiderer (who if he be not a perfect Atheiſt, and ſerves a turn in this Paper, muſt be a Papiſt in his heart) according to the Modeſty of the Gentleman, chargeth us with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical Equivocations in the Oath of Allegiance, while in the mean time he is equivocating the King out of his Throne, ſhifting the Duke into
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:50667:117"/> his place, by an aequivocal Abuſe of the word: the courſeſt ſlight that ever was uſed by any <hi>Hocus Pocus,</hi> or any Pretender to <hi>Legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet upon the Confidence of theſe weak and miſtaken Reaſonings, he preſumes to arraign the Houſe of Commons of the greateſt Injuſtice and Iniquity, and would have us apprehend Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very the Arbitrary and Deſpotical Power of Parliaments. The loſs of all Security either of Property or Liberty, by a prevailing Faction of Parliament; which he will be able to effect at the ſame time when he can perſwade us to diſſolve the Polity, and exchange the beſt and ſafeſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into an Anarchy. To be without Judges, for fear of unrighteous Sentences; and without a Power of Legiſlation, for fear of Laws of Iniquity. But it is not a new thing for obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious Criminals and Out-laws to turn Rebels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Government.</p>
                  <p>What this man is, and what the Cauſe is he Eſpouſes, is declared ſufficiently, in that he hath no better ways of Advocation and Defence, than by Oppoſing and Reviling the Government it ſelf; and he that dares revile the Government, would, if he had Power, Deſtroy it.</p>
                  <p>In that he calls the major part of the Houſe of Commons a Prevailing Faction, I challenge him Guilty of the Higheſt Treaſon, of a Treaſon not onely againſt this Government, but of a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent Treaſon, of a Treaſon virtually againſt
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:50667:118"/> all mankind, for that we cannot ſubſiſt without Polities, and no Polities can ſubſiſt but by defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the reſults of the Governing Power, which is Interpretatively in the reſolves of the major part.</p>
                  <p>But he proceeds to queſtion, whether, by the Conſtitutions of this Government, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can extend their power to ſhut out the Duke from ſucceeding to the Crown; for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting (he means) That it is Juſt, which we will not accept of as a voluntary conceſſion of this Conſiderer, (for that it doth appear not onely Juſt, but highly neceſſary, to exclude the Duke by Bill) he will then draw it into queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be any competent power in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment for doing a thing not onely juſt, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary for the preſervation of the King and Kingdom? Whether there be any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject too great for Juſtice, or any private Right that is not governable, and may not be ordered as to the Legiſlature ſhall ſeem neceſſary to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the whole? Whether that which is properly the Right of the Community (for ſo is the Succeſſion) may receive no alteration in a ſingle inſtance, for the Weightieſt Reaſons? and whether he that declares that he will not Govern, but Deſtroy, and doth virtually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Government, may not be left out of the Succeſſion? This is the true ſtate of the Queſtion; and the Queſtion thus ſtated, gives its own ſolution; And who, except thoſe of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:50667:118"/> the Conſpiracy, do not ſo ſtate it, and allow it?</p>
                  <p>As to his Queſtion, Whence the Parliament derives their Power: let him know, that the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament derive their Power and Authority from the ſame Original the King derives His: The King hath not His Power from them, nor they theirs from the King: They both derive their Authority from the Conſent of the People in the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Government, either tacit or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or by their expreſs or tacit Conſent, in the inſenſible, and little, or great, and more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alterations that the Government hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the courſe of Time.</p>
                  <p>The King can make the Parliaments Power no greater than it is, nor they His. Though true it is, he may put an unlimited Truſt repoſed in Him, into Stated Laws, and Govern by Counſels eſtabliſhed into Laws; which is not to alter or leſſen His Power, but to make it more Safe and Wiſe, and impeccable in the exerciſe of it. He may aſcertain the indefinitneſs of his Power, that it may not be abus'd. And that King doth beſt provide for a happy and wiſe Adminiſtration of his Government, who leaves the feweſt things to fortuitous reſolves, who reduceth his Prerogative to the meaſures of Common Right, and makes the Kingdom ſecure and ſafe, by leaving the Succeſſion leſs Capacity and Scope to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
                  <p>It is moſtly incumbent upon his Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to ſecure the Government committed to his
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:50667:119"/> Care, and keep it upright, and ſteady upon its own Baſis, and to preſerve all things in a due and Legal Courſe: To watch to prevent all machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations againſt it, and ſuch as would deſtroy and ſubvert it; and by his executive power of the Laws, obtain to us the ends of Government, that we may live quiet and peaceable Lives in all Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Honeſty. For the ſake of this High Truſt, and the Dignity of this Office, his Perſon is moſt Sacred and Inviolable.</p>
                  <p>The King and his great Council providing for the eſtabliſhment and ſecurity of the Government in their proceedings are not tyed up to forms of Judicial proceedings; but are to act upon ſuch inducements, and in ſuch methods, whereby the Wiſeſt men govern their affairs; in which they are at perfect Liberty, and not under the reſtraint of Laws. They cannot do unjuſtly, whatever me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods or means they uſe, that are prudentially and morally neceſſary to this End.</p>
                  <p>This power can be no more wanting in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, than we can be without Government: That which eſtabliſheth the one (which is the Law of God declared in the Make and Frame of Humane Nature) affirms and allows the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>By the Authority of this Law of God ſo decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and promulgated, as I have told you, <hi>do Kings Reign, and Senators or Princes Decree Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> By virtue of this Law, and in Obedience to it, is this Bill fram'd (againſt which this Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:50667:119"/> declaims like a ſpeaking Brute.) From this Law of God, the ſaid Bill when it paſſeth into a Law, will have its Approbation, Sanction and Eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p>But againſt this Bill, with his accuſtomed Truth, Candor and Modeſty, he doth object, That if ſuch an Authority ſhall belong to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as to diſable one ſucceſſor upon ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements as are ſufficiently known; a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſome time or other may be corrupted by a King, and by mercenarineſs comply with him to ſell the Succeſſion of the Crown to a Foreigner. We all well enough know, that this Bill is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to keep out the Tyranny of <hi>France,</hi> or at leaſt the <hi>French</hi> Tyranny: But for this I leave the King to reckon with him and the Penſioners of the late long Parliament.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman continues to add the ſtory of <hi>Ahab,</hi> contriving to poſſeſs himſelf of <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, by cauſing him to be falſly accuſed of Blaſpheming God and the King; by which, if true, by the Jewiſh Laws, <hi>Ahab</hi> had been Juſtly entitled to it as a Royal Eſcheat. But if he had not been as ſtupid as a Block, he had not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this ſtory, which is a preſident and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd caſe againſt himſelf; who, but a Line be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had ſo vilely Blaſphemed ſo great a King, a far greater King than <hi>Ahab,</hi> though the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment divide ſome Authority with the King in the Government: But what were the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Monarchy, this Writer of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:50667:120"/> I am ſure, knows no more than his Foot-boy. But let him know, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a Blaſpheming God; and to bring the Kings Life in danger, is worſe than to Blaſpheme him. See what wiſe Work this Conſiderer makes; when, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, he would argue, That the Duke of <hi>York</hi> cannot be ſhut out of the Succeſſion, no more than <hi>Ahab</hi> could take <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard from him.</p>
                  <p>The man of Weighty Conſiderations tells us in the next Paragraph, That God was Incenſed againſt <hi>Eſau</hi> for ſelling his Birth-right; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duke muſt not loſe his, contrary to his Will, and all Juſtice, by a prevailing Faction of his Inferiours.</p>
                  <p>Who ever told him, That God was Incenſed againſt <hi>Eſau</hi> for ſelling his Birth-right? Did not God purpoſe the Birth-right to <hi>Jacob,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Brothers were born, and before they had done Good or Evil? Could God be angry with him for agreeing and executing his own Purpoſe and Decree? Did not <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Rebekah</hi> both know and underſtand the Oracle, and in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to it, <hi>Jacob</hi> was effectively Bleſſed by his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s confirming the Bleſſing firſt gotten by ſurprize, and by the Solemnity of that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> transferred the right of the Promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be fulfilled in the Line of <hi>Jacob?</hi> Indeed the place he quotes in <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.17. is this, <hi>Let no Whoremonger or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Perſon be amongſt you, like</hi> Eſau, that would prefer a Senſual pleaſure before the great things
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:50667:120"/> that were promiſed by our Lord to them that obey him. Wherein the mention of <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is only to illuſtrate and ſet off what they fell ſhort of the Grace of God, and the deſigns of his Holy Inſtitution. Indeed, if he could prove to us, that his Royal Highneſs, being the younger Brother, had any ſuch thing tranſmitted to him in his Generation, as the <hi>Jews</hi> called the <hi>Segulah</hi> (by which they mean ſome peculiarity, which did appropriate the Right of the Promiſes made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>) which <hi>Jacob</hi> had, and <hi>Eſau</hi> wanted, they ſay; If he had any Divine mark upon him (beſides the Contingency of his Birth) that deſign'd him &amp; mark'd him for a King, beſides <hi>Roman</hi> Zeal, there would be ſome Conſequence in his Diſcourſe, and this would be the beſt Argument that he hath yet us'd (though the King would be little beholden to him for it:) But where God doth not interpoſe by expreſs Revelation, Humane Affairs, Concerns and Intereſts of all ſorts, muſt be Governed and Ruled by the Laws, Orders and Decrees of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Governments. I would not have been ſo long in animadverting upon this laſt paſſage, but that I think our Conſiderer hath taken into his aſſiſtance in theſe Conſiderations ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, by his abounding ſo much in Scriptural Allegations: And that hereby you may ſee the Size of the reſt of the men of that Order, that are Chaplains to the Cauſe of the Succeſſion, and that they ought to be of little regard in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as they deſerve none; it being not in their
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:50667:121"/> way: though in matters that belong properly to their Function, they may deſerve much who are of the meaneſt of that Order.</p>
                  <p>Our Gentleman next proceeds to his political Arguments; but thoſe can be anſwered, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, by every man who hath heard of the Plot. Though a man of his Size may frame puzzling Arguments that may perplex mens Minds with ſcruples and doubts; which a Fool may do, and a Wiſe man cannot remove; yet it is ſcarce poſſible for him to deprive men of their Senſes, and make them inſenſible to all the Evils that they hear, ſee, and feel, and juſtly fear. If the Proteſtants are not (as he ſaith) very ſtrong abroad, we have reaſon to be more united at home, and united by the awful Authority of a Law. If we are threatned with a great power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion from abroad, (which he affrights us with) we have no reaſon to retain the biggeſt power to hurt us within our own Bowels. But if it be in the power of ſuch bad men as this Pretender to divide by ſlights and wiles the good People of <hi>England,</hi> and keep them from uniting in the onely means of their ſafety, we muſt periſh: But Wo be to them by whom we are thus deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>His laſt effort upon the minds of the People is to intimidate them, that by their fears they may fall under the evils they deſign upon us: he ſcatters his menaces, as if he were in the place of God againſt us, and as if he had the executing of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:50667:121"/> the Plot in his Power, and tells us of ſins that fit us for ruine. It is convenient to theſe Plotters to imagine us mighty wicked, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we deſerve the Vengeance they deſign. Our Government it ſelf, our Laws, our Religion muſt become wicked, when they arrive to a probable power to hurt us: They never contrive a Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Plot, a Maſſacre, or burning a City, but they dream the iniquity of the People is grown ripe; They would turn us into <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha</hi> (which this Conſiderer frights us with) if they could call for Fire from Heaven; and then publiſh us to all the world (if we were much better than we are) to be as wicked as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Plain. If we cannot obtain this Bill, I ſhall then begin to think, that the Decree is gone forth, and our Fate is approaching, and that God will let theſe Villains have their will over us. By Gods diſpleaſure, not theirs, I ſhall take the true meaſures of our Sins; His diſpleaſure will be remarkable and evident, if he ſeems to deny us the means of our Safety and Preſervation, and which is the onely means of the Kings Salvation from their Traiterous deſign. If this Bill do not paſs, they will take him for a wicked King too; and they will ſay, he hath no lawful Iſſue to ſucceed him, for his own ſins (though our Conſiderer ſaith at preſent, that our Sins are the cauſe of it) and many other remarks of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they will make upon him, when they find it convenient and for their intereſt to deſtroy
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:50667:122"/> him; at beſt he will be then but Tenant at Will to them of his Life, as well as his Crown, which this Conſiderer moſt ſlanderouſly chargeth to be deſigned by us: but if he will follow the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of that excellent Bill, he may live long, and ſee good days, and peace upon our <hi>Iſrael;</hi> to which let all good people ſay, <hi>AMEN.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall onely remark two or three things in the cloſe of the Paper of <hi>Weighty Conſiderations.</hi> Firſt, that he undertakes to ſay and affirm, that the King is as much ſubject to the Power of the Parliament as the Duke; which doth dethrone the King himſelf, and leſſens him to the degree of a Subject. Secondly, that in this his Addreſs he perſwades the King to rend the Government, to lay aſide the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them as Rebels; to divide from them, and govern by a Houſe of Lords and Privy Council. And thirdly, that the moſt venerable and Loyal Parliament that ever was conven'd in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not ſo clearly purged from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Villains of the late long Parliament, as the next we hope will be, are charged by him to follow the Anarchical Encroachments of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the Rump-Parliament; by which he inſinuates that we muſt become Papiſts, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Popiſh Succeſſor, or be uſed as Rebels and Traitors: by theſe three Remarks it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, what Principles and Deſigns theſe men are of, that oppoſe the Dukes Bill; and from thence you may find reaſon to aſſiſt it, and promote it
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:50667:122"/> with the greateſt unanimity and reſolution; and the rather, for that the Duke himſelf cannot want Conſiderations to diſpoſe him to approve of it.</p>
                  <p>For what ſhould he do with a Crown that he cannot wear? Why ſhould he accept of a truſt that he cannot diſcharge, and a Government that his Principles oblige him to transfer to a Forein Prince? he is too generous a Prince to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Province onely to betray it.</p>
                  <p>He is a Prince of great Charity: it was that ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mov'd him publickly to confeſs the <hi>Roman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that he might thereby recommend that Religion to our belief, for the better reforming us from Hereſie: Why then ſhould not the ſame Charity move him to renounce the Government, leſt he ſhould offer an irreſiſtable temptation to the People to a Rebellion? a greater ſin accounted by a King, though a Catholick, (however the Prieſts rate it) than an errour in belief.</p>
                  <p>But how can we imagine that he will conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to be our King? He doth not intend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of our Oaths of Allegiance, and had rather not be King, than we ſhould be his Subjects upon thoſe terms. Why ſhould we trouble him with the name of King, reproach him, call him Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, Heretick, and Infidel, by ſwearing our ſelves his Subjects in the terms of the Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and Supremacy? Pray think no more of it, write no more <hi>Great and Weighty Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> for he intends to be no more your King,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:50667:123"/> than he doth to deſert his Religion and the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholick Faith.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, his Zeal and Services, and the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that he hath undergone for that Church, and the hazards he hath incur'd, deſerve the beſt Place, and higheſt Office in that Church, which is that of a Prieſt; he ought not to be put off, and meanly rewarded with the Sheriffalties, which their Eminencies of the Conclave deſpiſe, and be prefer'd to all the Drudgeries and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that the Prieſthood of that Church require of the Kings of that Communion that become Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots.</p>
                  <p>He is a Prince that can deliberate and conſider, and will conclude, that it is better for him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelf to a Monaſtery now, before he hath filled the Land with Blood and Slaughter, and all the miſchiefs that the helliſh Plot deſigns upon us, than to take Sanctuary in one hereafter, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the melancholy conſiderations of a loſt deſign, and intolerable guilt, if he himſelf ſhould chance to ſurvive, and not periſh ingloriouſly in the enterprize, never to be gathered to his Fathers, and ſhut out of the Sepulchres of Kings.</p>
                  <p>He is a great lover of his Brother, as he ought in gratitude to be, who lets him live, and in his good opinion too, after he had departed from his Allegiance, and become a Member of another Hoſtile Polity and Regimen, and after, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence thereof, the King's Life is brought in conſpicuous danger: Beſides, that it was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:50667:123"/> and neceſſary that attempts upon the Life of the King ſhould enſue upon his publick declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf to be a Papiſt. And we cannot, without thinking too meanly of him, think him without a foreſight thereof: there remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no way for him to avoid the guilt of his Brother's Murder, (we tremble at the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of it) than by renouncing the Crown. The King cannot in probability die before him, except he falls to the Intereſt of that Religion which his Highneſs doth profeſs. So that the Duke will relinquiſh nothing by the conſenting to the Bill, but the hopes to ſucceed upon his Brother's Murder; but he would not the one (ſo virtuous we will think him) to obtain the other.</p>
                  <p>Admit him to be King, he muſt be a King without Subjects; for he muſt be a Slave to one part of the people to deſtroy the other: theſe may not be, the other will not be his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>To be an open Enemy is more Princely, than to ſubmit to the ſordid methods of Falſhood and Treachery, than to betray us and deceive us in the confidence we juſtly ſhould have in him, if he ſhould ſucceed to the Crown by a legal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. He hath already departed from the Government, which is Treaſon in a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but we will give it in him an honeſter name, and call him onely an Enemy to our State and Religion, and his departure to be an overt decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Hoſtility; let him therefore be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:50667:124"/> with himſelf, purchaſe the Government by Conqueſt, by the aſſiſtance of the Arms of <hi>France,</hi> his Popiſh Adherents, and home-bred Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. But let him not aſſume the Crown by Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and Succeſſion, under obligations to govern by Law, and to preſerve us in our Religion, which is our Legal Right, and more precious to us than any thing elſe the Law entitles us unto. Let him not add falſhood to his miſtaken and cruel zeal, and do all the miſchiefs the Plot deſigns, while he pretends to Govern. Let him openly aſſault us Miſcreants, ſubdue us Infidels, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſtand Curſed and Excommunicated, whom he hath Warrant enough from his Religion to deſtroy with an utter deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>He is an excellent Son of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, of bleſſed Memory, who died a Martyr for the Government of Church and State, and loſt his Life as well as his Government, when he could not preſerve it any longer by his Sword; And do you think that <hi>James</hi> his Son, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Royal Name of his Grandfather, though the firſt of <hi>England,</hi> yet the Sixth of that Name in <hi>Scotland,</hi> will ſuffer the Government to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and to be a King and no King? It is more juſt for him to chuſe an Excluſion from the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, than to ſuffer the Government to be changed; we muſt therefore ſuppoſe him to be willing rather to conſent to the Bill and renounce the Succeſſion, conformably to the recent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his never-to-be-forgotten Father, than
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:50667:124"/> to conſent to, or be bound by any Act of Parliament that ſhall alter the Government: They are not his Friends, nor agreeable to him, that would ſpoil the Government, more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his eſteem (as well as his Father's) than a perſonal Reign: That would make him a King in mockery; That conſpire againſt the Government it ſelf, which he will not, he ought not to ſuſtain and endure, as long as there is any Iron and Steel in the hands, or Blood in the Veins of Loyal <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks.</p>
                  <p>He is an equal Prince, and will not take it ſo much to Heart, that he ſees the People of his Nativity not ſtupid Sots, but that they can be ſenſible of the dangers that he urgeth them with, and provide apt remedies againſt the evils which threaten us.</p>
                  <p>But if theſe Reaſons will not obtain his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Conſent to that Law for his Excluſion, they will be allowed Inducements ſufficient enough to paſs it and conclude his Aſſent; for the nature of a Law is, to be firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and to make thoſe willing that ſhould be conſenting to it as reaſonable and fit, but are not, and to render them obedient and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: For this is one of the greateſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Government, that they that cannot or will not chuſe what is beſt for themſelves, the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:50667:125"/> Laws will chuſe for them, with regard to the Publick Good.</p>
                  <p>For the better clearing the matter of the Conſtitutions of this Realm, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Succeſſion, I thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to add the ſubſtance of an Act of Parliament yet in force, made 13 <hi>Elizabethae.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t offers, deſerves to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>We will not follow him from Paragraph to Paragraph, ſince the greateſt part of it is vain and empty, pedantick, bombaſt, and putid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall onely draw you up ſhort Summaries of his ſeveral Reaſons, and give them all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages they can challenge, and improve them by juſt and natural Inferences: And that I think will be enough of confutation, and a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent countercharm againſt his deceiving the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>He firſt lays down for a Ground, That the Succeſſion to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> is inſepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able annexed to Proximity and nextneſs of Bloud, by the Laws of God and Nature; And all Statute-Laws contrary to the Laws of God and Nature, are, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> null and void.</p>
                  <p>That it is contrary to the Laws of God, he
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:50667:128"/> proves by the Law of God given by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the 7th of <hi>Numbers,</hi> that directs how the Succeſſion of Lands ſhould be amongſt the <hi>Jews;</hi> and whatſoever Statute-Laws are contrary to thoſe Laws are null and void, he ſaith.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence of this Argument is this That the Laws given by God to the <hi>Jews</hi> are Laws to all Mankind: That our common-Law and Statute-Law is againſt the Law of God, and null and void, becauſe not agreeable to the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> That the eldeſt Son is not to take by Deſcent the whole inheritance, but a double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely, and that the Crown muſt be diſpoſed of in Deſcents accordingly: That not the firſt Son only, and one Daughter, but all the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a King, if never ſo many, muſt ſucceed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the Crown: That no Father can ſell his Patrimony; for that was the Jewiſh Law, and eſtabliſhed in that Chapter he quotes.</p>
                  <p>He proves it to be a Law of God further, for that God ſaith to <hi>Cain</hi> of <hi>Abel, That his deſires ſhall be ſubject, and thou ſhalt rule over him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conſequence of this, is, that becauſe <hi>Cain</hi> could not kill <hi>Abel,</hi> (notwithſtaning he was to have the Primacy) That <hi>Abel</hi> much more could not kill <hi>Cain</hi> his Elder Brother.</p>
                  <p>And further he proves that to be a Law of God, becauſe God maketh choice of the firſt-born to be Sanctified and Conſecrated to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And therefore it moſt certainly follows, with this Gentlemen, that he which is not the firſt-born
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:50667:128"/> muſt be ſo too. I wiſh his Royal Highneſs, the ſecond born, the Conſecration of a Prieſt; (which the Text means, notwithſtanding the Text doth not allow it him) ſo that he will not pretend to the Conſecration of a King, which is clearly out of the meaning of the Text.</p>
                  <p>He ſays, Conſonant hereunto are the Suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Doctors of the Civil and Imperial Law.</p>
                  <p>The Conſequence of this is, firſt, That he is not bound to be coherent to himſelf; for he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proving the Law of God to be, That the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Crown is inſeparably annxed to proximity of bloud, and now he tells us of ſome Opinions of Fathers and Doctors that are conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant thereunto, when they do not at all relate in their Opinions to what he had produced out of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law. Secondly, it follows, that he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently troubleſome to his Reader, by telling him of the Opinions of great names in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Eldeſt Son by ordinary right is to have his Fathers Eſtate in ſome Countries, or that the Crown doth ſo ordinarily deſcend where the Succeſſion is hereditary; he ſhould have ſpared them for another time, when he ſhall ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that all mankind doth not agree in. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That he is a man of little reading, otherwiſe he would have been inſufferably impertinent by 10000 quotations in this matter. Fourthly, That he is no Civilian? for that in this place he calls the Soveraignity a Fee, when all men agree that a Crown is of that fort of Inheritancs, which
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:50667:129"/> they call Allodiums, that are held <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. This would have made a ſwinging Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> if he had thought of it, but we will give it them <hi>gratis.</hi> He tells us the Duke of <hi>York</hi> is in the ſame condition as the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son of the King Reigining, though his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be King: That the ſecond Son of a King Regent, when the firſt is dead, living his Father, is within the 25. of <hi>E.</hi> 3. that makes it Treaſon to compaſs the death of the King's Eldeſt Son; and that ſuch Second Son is Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Cornwal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conſequence whereof is, that he very impertinent, or elſe the Duke of <hi>York</hi> is now Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and that he is within the Statute of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>This Argument of his he leaves to be further illuſtrated and purſued by the Church-men and Civilians: But leſt they ſhould fail, this Epiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler (for I now am well aſſured, that this queſtion and cauſe is to be managed by the Sword, by Maſſacres, and the <hi>French</hi> Plot, and not by Writing) I have adventured, and will proceed to illuſtrate his Arguments, and purſue them into their Conſequences, &amp; leave the Epiſtoler of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to be purſued with laughter; for he deſerves no worſe, if it be true that he profeſſeth, that he is a Proteſtant and Lover of the Government.</p>
                  <p>Now he will, he ſaith, as beſt ſorting with his profeſſion, and with a diſcourſe of the nature, drive proofs from the Authority of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:50667:129"/> and Statute-Law of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence it follows, That the Common-Law and Statute-Laws of <hi>England</hi> are proper to be conſulted with, for declaring the Laws of God, and the Laws of Nature; which they never yet pretended to do. And Secondly, it follows from thence, that this Epiſtoler no more underſtands the Common and Statute-Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and what places they are to have in the Conduct of our manners, and guidance of our Conſciences; than he doth (as appears by what he hath ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) what is the Law of God or Nature.</p>
                  <p>He lays it down as moſt evident, <hi>That all the humane Acts and Powers in the World cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Diſcent of the Crown upon the next Heir of the Blood? becauſe (though they may hinder the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of it) This is a Dowry which the great King of Kings hath reſerved to his own immidiate Donation, and hath placed above the reach of a mortal Arm; and mankind can no more hinder or intercept it, than it can the Influences of the Stars or the Heavens upon the Sublunary world, or beat down the Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Conſequence of this is, that the man is Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick and of inſane memory and hath forgot and denies what in the ſame breath he affirms: Eor, he agrees humane Power may hinder the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enjoyment, and yet it is no more poſſible to hinder the Deſcent, than to ſtop the Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Heaven, and to pull down the Moon. Secondly, It follows, that that which is done is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:50667:130"/> impoſſibe to be done. Thirdly, that there is no Right at all by Deſcent, nor can be any Deſcent of the Crown; for that it is reſerved, as he ſays, to Gods immediate Donation, And we never yet heard of any immediate Gift or Donation thereof from God. And if the Duke will ſtay until that be done, we moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly declare we will accept him for our King; and he ſhall be a King to intents and purpoſes (as he terms it;) we will be kinder and juſter to him than his Freinds of the ſame perſwaſion with the Epiſtoler, who will give him the Name and Style, and would Abridge him, as they pretend, of the Power and Authority of a King.</p>
                  <p>He ſays further, That when the Duke is King, that the Legiance and Fidelity of the Subject is due to him by the immutable Law of Nature; from whence it clearly follows, that he muſt ſtay until that time come: That when he is a Loyal and Foyal King, we are to be Loyal and Foy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Liege-men and Subjects, For <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe which he cites, by the general Opinions of all conſiderable Lawyers, is Apocryphal, where it makes Allegiance abſolute, and more extenſive than the Legal Power of Kings. But here he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns ſuch loathſom Pedantry, that I cannot but remark it: He ſubjoyns to his mention of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Caſe, that <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> Nature's Amanuenſis (as he calls him) agrees with that Caſe, in that he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. and <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>'s <hi>Natura commenta eſt Regem.</hi> But for my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:50667:130"/> ſake, I will make no further Obſervations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, than by bare repeating of it to expoſe it.</p>
                  <p>That the King and his Succeſſors are Kings by Nature, he proves; <hi>For that the Statute Laws do frequently ſtile the King our Natural Liege-Lord: And for further proof tells us, that in Indictments it is ſet forth, that the Treaſon is commited</hi> contra debitum Fidei &amp; Ligeantiae quod naturaliter &amp; de jure impendere debet: <hi>And the King in Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is ſometimes ſtyled Natural Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence it follows, that we are born under Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; that no man that is born under any form of Government can deny Faith unto it, though he never expreſly ſwore Allegiance. That the King of <hi>France</hi> is not our Natural Lord, neither doth the Oath of Allegiance bind us to that Form of Government, if introduced, becauſe the King was born to no ſuch King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: Nor is our King a Natural Lord to any Forreigners that come hither; and the Form of the Indictment againſt Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as the Lawyers know, muſt be in another Form. And further it followes, That in all chan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges of Government, the word natural is to be adjoyned to Allegiance in all Indictments of Treaſon committed againſt the Government in its ſeveral changes that it may ſuffer; And this all the Lawyers with one voice pronounce.</p>
                  <p>He ſums up all that he hath ſaid before, thus: <hi>No humane Power can hinder the Deſcent of the Crown upon the Right Heir; the Deſcent makes
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:50667:131"/> the King, Allegiance is due to the King by the Law of Nature; The Law of Nature cannot be abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by humane Power: That Common-Law is more worthy than Statute-Law, and the Law of Nature more worthy than both.</hi> But upon better conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the whole matter, it follows with better Conſequence, That Nature hath made no Laws about Property, nor about Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; otherwiſe all Laws of Right and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and all Governments would have been the ſame; for what ſhe makes are Univerſal, as the Nature of man: Beſides that if he knew where ſhe became a Legiſlatrix, or if this Gentleman could direct us to a veiw of her Pandects, we ought to acoord all our Laws to them. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That Common-Law is not to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Statute-Law; For the Judges who declare the Common-Law are not wiſer than Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and the Common-Law appears ſo bad a Rule, that it requires oftentimes amendment. Thirdly, It follows, that no Legiſlation is Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for that which is to be preferred, is beſt, and that which is beſt is to be a Law for ever. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That no Allegiance is due to any Prince, but whom the Law appoints, and as the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points: That he that is not King, to him no Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance is due. That humane Power is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent enough to alter as well as make any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Conſtitution. That which by humane Authority was made, and made alſo deſcendible (for all Crowns are not deſcendible) can be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:50667:131"/> by the ſame Authority in its Diſcent.</p>
                  <p>The greater part of this enſuing Diſcourſe, is, the remembrance of the Tragedies that have been acted upon the Engliſh Nation by our Kings: For we have not only ſuffered under their bad Government, but they have Uſurpt one upon another, and we have been infinitely miſerable by being drawn into Wars, to diſpute which of them ſhould Govern us after their own manner and faſhion. If this Epiſtoler had had any reguard to mankind, any bowels and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration for the vaſt Miſeries and Calamities which we have ſuffered thereby, except he had depreſſed all mankind ſo far below this Jure-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity Head, as if they were no more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than a ſwarm of Flies, and ought to periſh by Thouſands, to the Pleaſure, Luſt and Ambition of any that is big enough to pretend to a Crown; he had not here talked ſo gloriouſly of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Succeſſion; he would have put the Crown in Cypreſs, and vail'd its ſplendour with a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dreſs; he would not have talked of Pearls and Oriency, (in his fooliſh ſtyle) Jewels and Gems of Magnitude.</p>
                  <p>But, if they, by Cruelty and Treachery have murdered one another, and uſurpt upon the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right of Succeſſion, and did keep the people in a ſtate of War for Centuries of years; ſhall not we exclude a ſingle Perſon from the Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to prevent more and greater Miſeries to be
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:50667:132"/> executed perhaps in one year upon this poor Nation, than the former Uſurpations did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in Centuries of years?</p>
                  <p>But let him attempt the Crown, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an Act of Parliament for his Excluſion, he is all that while but attempting to make us miſerable; if he be not excluded, he doth it certainly: We exclude only his Perſon, not his Poſterity; and we will not entail a War upon the Nation, though for the ſake and intereſt of the Glorious Family of the <hi>Stuarts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Argument he produceth is this, <hi>viz.</hi> that in Acts of Parliament the Right of Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is called a Natural Right, and conſequently that it is unalterable. The conſequence of this Argument is, that a Right by Birth is a natural Right, and that truly; for men are born by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Secondly, It follows, that no man hath a natural Right by Birth to the Inheritance of his Father, or that his Father cannot give it from him, or he himſelf forecloſe himſelf by Treaſon and Felony. Or elſe it follows, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Princes of the Bloud ſucceed by the right of their Birth, which is a natural Right, or a Right by Nature; they may be ſet aſide, and excluded the Succeſſion to the Crown upon as great reaſon as we have for this Bill of Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>His Law-<hi>Farrago</hi> of Statutes that have been adjudged void, becauſe unreaſonable and impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, concludes, that a Statute-Law in a matter
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:50667:132"/> that is not unreaſonable and impoſſible, is a good and binding Law; and therefore he ought to have a profound veneration and deference to it (in which we uſe only his own words in this matter, which are the leaſt fooliſh) when it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth into a Law.</p>
                  <p>But if he cannot find the reaſonableneſs of this Bill, in what we have offered, we may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude, that nothing will convince him but French Auxiliaries, and a Stack of Faggots in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> If this Act be impoſſible to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, we muſt conclude that it is in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Party to execute our Laws, Religion, and Government, and to Aſſaſſinate the Nation. We wiſh only, on the behalf of our Religion and Government, that we had as great aſſurance that the Bill would paſs into a Law, as the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs thereof is evident.</p>
                  <p>But this Epiſtoler (whoſe Province he ſaith is Law) nextly undertakes to ſay, <hi>That the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſſion of the Crown to the next Heir of the Bloud, is a Foundamental and Primary Conſtitution of this Realm, and indeed the Baſis and Foundation of all our Laws. The Succeſſion of the Crown to the next Heir of the Bloud, is one of the higheſt, eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and undivided Rights of the Crown. That no Perſon or Community can give away, or transfer, a thing which they never had to give. Of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Right of Succeſſion to the Crown, which is not the gift of a man, but the immediate Dowry</hi>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:50667:133"/> (that World he is fond of) <hi>of God, Nature, and the immutable Cuſtoms of the State.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence it follows, that God, Nature, and the immutable Cuſtoms of State, met together once upon a time about this Matter; or that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Cuſtoms of State did ſometime conſult God and Nature about this matter; and agreed their Sentiments. Or,</p>
                  <p>God and Nature and immutable Cuſtoms of State are all one: That Cuſtoms of State are made without People: That Cuſtoms of State are as immutable as God and Nature: That God and Nature cannot alter that which is once a Cuſtom: That God cannot be heard, though he interpoſeth with all the Obligations that he lays upon us to Humanity and Juſtice, from his own Philanthropy and Juſtice, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the whole Body of an Innocent Nation, from, deſtroying Zeal and waſting Superſtition; nor Nature her ſelf be heard in her cloſe injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of ſelf-preſervation: But immutable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom a more powerful Supream, muſt prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and Nature, though at firſt they ſtuck together in making this Primary Conſtitution the Baſis and Foundation of all Laws: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe was certainly in the mind of God and Nature ſo much, as to ſet up a Royal Family a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us a part of Mankind. And to ſhew a particular kindneſs to the Engliſh People (for he hath not dealt ſo with every Nation:) That he doth not certainly think us worthy of any
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:50667:133"/> Laws, any Lives or Eſtates, if we do not aceept of this ſingular favour, nor if we do accept, wo worth us miſerable people. But Laws, it ſeems, we can have none without it; for that's the true Baſis and Foundation (ſaith he) of all Laws. And this follows with good reaſon; for the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Crown to the next of Bloud, is one of the higheſt, moſt eſſential, and undivided Rights of the Crown: for it is clear we muſt loſe our preſent King, and he be divided from his Life and Crown, rather then the Succeſſion be devided from the next of Bloud; and after that, what matters it what becomes of the People, of no regard certainly, of no regard at all, nor to be conſidered, where the Rights or pretences of Kings are concerned.</p>
                  <p>And further, becauſe Kings cannot alienate the Crown, which doth not lie in Dominion, but in Truth: not in Property, but in care; for <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium eſt imperare, non regnum:</hi> And becauſe that people cannot be ſold like Droves of Cattle: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is with clear and irrefragable reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by this Letter-writer, That the King muſt not live; that he cannot remove an irreſiſtible temptation againſt his own Life: And we muſt receive a King that hath devoted us a fat Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to his cruel Superſtition, as his party hath our King, that they may more eaſily come at us.</p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:50667:134"/>
                  <p>Laſtly, he ſaith, <hi>That the right Heir of the Crown cannot be bar'd or excluded by Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; becauſe the Acceſſion and Deſcent of the Crown in an inſtant abſolutely purgeth and diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth all Obſtructions and Incapacities whatſoever, created by the ſame Act of Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence it followes, that the Earl of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> if he were next Heir, might ſucceed, if he ſhould be attained of Treaſon of State by Parliament; wheras if the King cannot pardon him, as he cannot, he could not in that caſe of the deſcent of the Crown pardon himſelf. The Heir of the Crown attainted, upon the devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Crown upon him, is therefore pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the Attainder, becauſe he can pardon himſelf, and is intended to do ſo; but a Treaſon of State can never be pardoned by the King. Our young Lawyer knows well enough, that an incapacity by Act of Parliament to execute an Office growing upon a moral diſability of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the truſt of that Office, is not in the Kings power to pardon. Secondly, from hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that that Attainder which leaves a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to obtain a Pardon of the King, doth not at all differ from an Attainder that excludes all capacity from the King to pardon, and which in the Conſtitution of the Government he hath no power to pardon; ſuch are all Treaſons of State where the King is not the <hi>Pars laeſa,</hi> and where it is not a private wrong, a ſingle crime, but the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:50667:134"/> attempt is upon the whole Government. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hence it clearly follows, that he that is no King, and upon whom the Crown can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, (as it will not if this Bill paſſeth into an Act) he being without the Imperial Crown, without right, and without poſſeſſion of it, is yet a King. That there is no difference between an Act of Parliament which leaves the Succeſſor to a poſſibility of being purged from the Attainder it makes; and that Act of Parliament which leaves no ſuch poſſibility, qut doth moſt abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and expreſly exclude him.</p>
                  <p>His Poſitions muſt therefore be falſe, and his Arguments not concluding, from which ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious falſhoods and abſurdities are naturally infer'd.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of further argument, he tells us a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, <hi>of an Act of Parliament made</hi> 28 H. 8. cap. 7. <hi>to render Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>incapable of Succeſſion: And that ſhe notwithſtanding got into the Throne: And that Sir</hi> Nicholas Bacon <hi>(who had conſulted the Judges) told the Queen, that there needed no formal Repeal of the ſaid Act; for that</hi> Corona ſemel ſuſcepta, omnes omnino deſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus tollit.</p>
                  <p>The Conſequence of this is, that if the Duke can, notwithſtanding an Act for his Excluſion, get into the Thhone, he will; and ſo let him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:50667:135"/> that a King <hi>de facto,</hi> though a bad one, is not to be removed at the expence of a Civil War; that it is madneſs to part with a good one, when in poſſeſſion, and cruelty to the People.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Detrahere Dominum urbi ſervire parata.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>But afterwards in the 35 of <hi>Hen.</hi> the Eighth, the Crown was limited by Act of Parliament. in caſe the King and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> ſhould die without Heirs of ether of their Bodies, to the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Mary</hi> and the Heirs of her body; and for want of ſuch Heir, to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and the Heirs of her body.</p>
                  <p>We are no ways concerned in the juſtification of our Bill, to approve of the humorous Caprice of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and the arbitrary Laws that he made in his time about the Succeſſion: they are inſtances of his haughty Government, that he impoſed upon Parliaments, and that he took the Crown to be at his diſpoſe, and transferrable at his pleaſure, as his Money and Lands: a great indignity to Mankind, and an injury to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Government! But that the Succeſſion of the Crown is the right of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, their Appointment, their Conſtitution, and Creature in Parliament, and alterable as far the Bill deſigns, and for ſuch reaſons as preſſeth and urgeth in the Caſe of the Duke. Whether this, I ſay, is not to ſatisfaction proved in theſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:50667:135"/> Sheets; and whether this Epiſtoler hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced any ſhadow of Reaſon to prove the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, let the World judge: And whether he hath given us any thing for reaſon, but the inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant bluſter of Words, canting Language, and pedantick Nonſence, which will never paſs with any man of the leaſt ſpark of ſence for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Neither do we place the Right of Succeſſion to Government in the ſame rank with private Inheritances; nor ever were they governed in any Country by the ſame Rules; though this Epiſtoler hath produced the Laws of God by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jews</hi> (which was only to govern private Inheritances amongſt them) to prove the unalterable Succeſſion of the Crown amongſt us: which is ſo wild an impertinence, wherewtih he begins his Letter, that he will be aſhamed of it when he reviews it, and conceal his name for ever with care.</p>
                  <p>That there is one Rule for the Succeſſion of the Crown, and another for the Succeſſion of private Eſtates, is from theſe Reaſon; That pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Inheritances are diſpoſed of in Succeſſion, according to the preſumed Will of the <hi>Decedens,</hi> which is collected from the general Opinion and Practice of the people in diſpoſing of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates by Settlements; or by their Wills and Teſtaments, in caſe of Allodiums: or elſe the Succeſſion goes according to the direction and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:50667:136"/> limitation of the Lord made in the firſt collati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fee in caſe of Fees. But the Deſcent and Succeſſion of the Crown is governed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the preſumed Will of the People: and that preſumption of the Peoples Will is made by meaſuring and conſidering what is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to the publick good, or by the expreſs limitation of the People in their conferring the Royal Dignity. In Allodiums, in defect of Heirs, the Inheritance belongs to the Soveraign Power, as a thing that is <hi>Nullius in bonis,</hi> and hath no owner. In Fees, when the Family is extinct it Eſcheats to the Lord of the Fee.</p>
                  <p>In Crowns, upon the extinction of the Royal Family, it belongs to the People to make a new King, under what limitations they pleaſe, or to make none, for the Polity is not deſtroyed if there be no King appointed: and conſequently in caſe of this ceſſer or diſcontinuance of the <hi>Regnum,</hi> there may be Treaſon committed againſt the people.</p>
                  <p>That the Succeſſion of the Crown is directed according to the preſumed Will of the People, and collected from what is moſt expedient gives us the reaſon why one Daughter or Female of the next degree ſhall ſucceed to the Crown, and not all, if more than one; whereas a private Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance is equally divided amongſt them all: For it is the Intereſt, and therefore the preſumed Will of the People, that the Kingdom ſhould continue
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:50667:136"/> undivided. The ſtrength of the Kingdom is preſerved in being continued united, and the Peace and Concord of the People thereby eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
                  <p>That a Son by the Second <hi>Venter</hi> ſhall ſucceed to the Crown, which is not allowed in private Eſtates, is, becauſe one ſo born is equally of the Family of his Father; and the expectation of the people as great from him, being deſcended from that glorious Perſon upon whom the Crown was conferred by the people, or who after he had got into the Throne, obtained the ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the People. The ſame reaſon admits an Alien born, though he be eſtranged from us by his Birth.</p>

                  <p>Though what I have ſaid in this matter, is ſo obvious, that no conſidering man can eſcape theſe thoughts, yet I cannot think it impertinent to add it here, to clear what I have laid down in the precedent Sheets, as an undoubted truth, and evident in it ſelf; <hi>That the Succeſſion to the Crown is the peoples Right.</hi> But there is nothing, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to be allowed clear and evident, when we live in an Age wherein Fools and moſt ignorant perſons will undertake, by the Liberty of the Preſs, to print and publiſh to the world their crude thoughts, and with great aſſurance offer their uncouth Opinions with aſtoniſhing preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:50667:137"/> Beſides to the reaſonableneſs of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it is agreeable to the Illuſtrious <hi>Grotius, De Jure Belli &amp; Pacis,</hi> Lib. 2. cap. 7.</p>
                  <p>And nothing follows from his collected Law-caſes about the different Rules of Succeſſion of the Crown from private Fees, but that he is a very young Lawyer, or an old ſenſeleſs Jobber of Law-Caſes.</p>
                  <p>But I hope that all men that read him, will with reſentment think themſelves uſed with ſcorn, when they ſee what frivolous Fellows at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon them to deceive them; and will be fully convinced, that the Bill is reaſonable, juſt, and fit, ſince they have nothing better to object againſt it.</p>
                  <p>The laſt endeavour of the Epiſtoler is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Authority of Parliaments, and the Act made in the Thirteenth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The words of which are printed at the cloſe of the Papers againſt the man of <hi>Great and Weighty Conſiderations.</hi> Our caſe is not in its reaſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel to thoſe that introduced that Law, and occaſioned the making of that Declaration; but whatever was the particular Reaſon, the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that Parliament in that Act is general, and therefore it is an Authority not to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached, to prove that there is ſuch a power to alter the Succeſſion of the Crown, for great Ends, and weighty Reaſons, and juſt Cauſes. Beſides, that ſuch a power is lodged in the Parliament, is clearly proved by us from the nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:50667:137"/> in the foregoing Sheets: As alſo, that ſuch a power will not be abuſed by uſing it in this Bill of Excluſion, of which I hope no body upon the reading of them will retain any longer any manner of doubt. But I cannot, before I have done, but take notice of his little Artifice. in that he doth ſuggeſt, that by the Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of the Thirteenth of Queen <hi>Elizabeth, cap,</hi> 1. the Title of the Family of <hi>Stuarts</hi> is excluded; when it is evident by the words of the Act, that the Diſability there enacted is only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal. And his ſtory of Monſieur the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi> deſigning then to marry the Queen, is a falſe and malicious inſinuation, to hurt the memory of that excellent Princeſs. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, that King <hi>James</hi> and his Race had, and have, notwithſtanding the validity of that Act, a good Title to the Crown: And that the validity of that Act may be maintained, without derogation and injury to his Majeſties ſacred Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, whom God long preſerve.</p>

The Act of Parliament for Baſtardizing the Children of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, was in force until repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, after his Marriage with <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh comes in by no legal Title: Firſt, becauſe <hi>Edw.</hi> 4th his Daughter was then living. Secondly, his own Mother was then living. In his firſt Parliament the Crown was Entail'd upon him and the Heirs of his body. And obſervable it is, that after the death of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> his Queen, Daughter and Heir to <hi>Ed.</hi> 4th. there is no notice taken of any right which was pretended to by <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. during his Fathir's life, as being Son and Heir of his Mother, who had the legal Right to the Crown by an ordinary right of Succeſſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth Succeeded, who did (as all his Laws ſpeak) derive his Title to the Crown by the Fathers ſide, and not by the Mothers. In
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:50667:140"/> his Reign the Crown was Entail'd thrice by Act of Parliament, Confirm'd by the general Oaths both of the Spiritualty and the Laſty; and it was made High Treaſon to refuſe ſuch Oaths; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Attainders were in his time by particular Acts of parliament of ſeveral perſons who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſuch limitations of the Crown, and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Laws that made them.</p>
                     <p>But the great Law of the three was made in the 35th year of his Reign, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. whereby power was given him to give and diſpoſe by his Letters Patents, or by Will, the Imperial Crown of the Realm, to remain and come after his death, for want of lawful Heirs of Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to ſuch perſon or perſons, in remainder or rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as ſhould pleaſe his Highneſs. In which Act there was a Clauſe, that made it high Treaſon to ſpeak or write againſt that Act, or to go about to annul or repeal it. Beſides, there is another Proviſo in that Act, That if the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould not keep ſuch conditions which the King ſhould declare by his Letters Patents or laſt Will, the Imperial Crown ſhould come to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> And if the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſhould not obſerve the ſame, then the Crown was to go to ſuch perſon as the King by his Letters Patents, or laſt Will, ſhould limit and appoint.</p>
                     <p>By virtue of which limitation in the Act of Parliament afore-mentioned, <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth ſucceeded to the Crown, and after him Queen
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:50667:140"/> 
                        <hi>Mary:</hi> in whoſe Reign, in an Act of Parliament for Conformation of the Articles of Marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Crown was again Entail'd; but ſhe dying without Iſſue, the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> became Queen, who had been declared a Baſtard (as well as her Siſter <hi>Mary</hi>) in the life of their Father; and therefore ſucceeded to the Crown by force of the Entail made in the 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>Purſuant to theſe Preſidents in fact, in the 13. year of the Reign of Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made, declaratory of the power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the limitation of the Succeſſion, which made it highly penal to deny the Authority of an Act of Parliament for the limitation of the Crown. Several perſons in her time were procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt upon that Act, and had the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Traytor, and as Traitors executed for being contrary to that Law.</p>
                     <p>This Queen dying, King <hi>James</hi> ſucceeded, who was (as the Statute of Recognition made in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the firſt year of his Reign, declares) li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neally, rightfully, deſcended of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> eldeſt Daughter of the moſt renowned <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, and the high and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Princeſs Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Wife, eldeſt Daughter of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th, the ſaid Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> being eldeſt Siſter of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, Father of the High and mighty Princes of famous memory <hi>Elizabeth</hi> late Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is further obſervable, that upon the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:50667:141"/> of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> to King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> both the Crowns of <hi>Emgland</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> were entailed; whereby it was provided, that of the ſeveral Children to be begotten upon the Queen, one was to have the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> another <hi>Spain,</hi> another the <hi>Low Countries:</hi> The Articles of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to this purpoſe were confirmed by Act of Parliament and the Pope's Bull.</p>
                     <p>And by that Act of Parliament for confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Articles of Marriage, <hi>Philip</hi> was created King, and did exerciſe Soveraign Authority, and particularly in making Laws together with the Queen: the Stile of the Soveraign Aſſent to Bills in Parliament in their time being, <hi>Le Roy &amp; la Roigne les veulent.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And likewiſe for that it was agreed by the States of both Kingdomes, and the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> it is therefore probable, that it was the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal opinion of the great men of that Age, That Kings and Soveraign Princes, by and with the conſent of their States, had a power to alter and bind the Succeſſion of the Crown.</p>
